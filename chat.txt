31/08/15, 10:35 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: It's coming!
31/08/15, 10:35 AM - Neha Karnad: So guys, because we've been doing a lot of crazy things in our lectures, and its best to have them restricted to the 75 of us only, unless we like inviting trouble, we needed this group without the MBA2s
31/08/15, 10:35 AM - Neha Karnad: They're nice folks and we have nothing personal
31/08/15, 10:35 AM - Neha Karnad: So feel free to make all the fun plans on the other grouo
31/08/15, 10:36 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: We just don't want thing taken out of context
31/08/15, 10:36 AM - Ryan Shields: Did something happen?
31/08/15, 10:36 AM - Neha Karnad: Just avoid the controversial stuff there..
31/08/15, 10:36 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Just being safe
31/08/15, 10:36 AM - Julia Wu: good thinking
31/08/15, 10:37 AM - Neha Karnad: These things don't really knock before they come! So lets just be cautious?
31/08/15, 10:37 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: The president of the class is there and we don't know how she took all the stats jokes.
31/08/15, 10:37 AM - Andrea: Good idea, thanks 😉
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Chiren Shah: 👍
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Neha Karnad: This is just how we interpreted things, nothing personal for anyone whatsoever!
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Christian Gagne: It's a smart play
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: she had a responsibility to look out for us
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Deepti Kaul: I agree! I wouldn't want people to misunderstand me if they don't know me!
31/08/15, 10:38 AM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>

31/08/15, 10:39 AM - Neha Karnad: We didn't want to take them out of the group
31/08/15, 10:39 AM - Bryan Au: 👍🏼
31/08/15, 10:39 AM - Neha Karnad: Cause that would seem sneaky! Hence a separate group..
31/08/15, 10:40 AM - Neha Karnad: Do not let the conversation die down to 0 either 😂
31/08/15, 10:40 AM - Ryan Shields: Gotta keep up with appearances
31/08/15, 10:40 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: We need THIS group to get through class though
31/08/15, 10:41 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: All that said.  A quick announcement from me and Erik.
31/08/15, 10:41 AM - Neha Karnad: We need both groups! After class plans on the other one and in class on this one.
31/08/15, 10:41 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: with regards to the next tutoring session, I passed on your availabilites but it will depend on the tutor's availability. On another note, this initiative was Prof Hart's idea and he will officially announce it next week so when he does, let's all take a minute to thank him.
31/08/15, 10:41 AM - Ryan Shields: Standing ovation?
31/08/15, 10:42 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Hahaha

31/08/15, 10:46 AM - Neha Karnad: Will work anywhere but stats!
31/08/15, 10:50 AM - Christian Gagne: Preach 🙏
31/08/15, 1:24 PM - Angela Hernandez: Guys since there are so many international students (me included) I was thinking we should live the hockey experience together, from what I know going to a hockey game is pretty awesome here. We have just got an email saying we can buy tickets on sale through McGill...maybe somebody that actually knows about hockey would like to take the lead of this initiative?
31/08/15, 1:24 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: 👍🏼
31/08/15, 1:30 PM - Christian Gagne: I believe there's a few good games right after our Value Creation Exam? Could make for a fun group outing.
31/08/15, 1:31 PM - Karen Sidhu: Yah great idea! I can look into the schedule and throw some options out there :)
31/08/15, 1:32 PM - Christian Gagne: I think they play the Red Wings on the 13/14th or something like that. Weekend after the exam and the long weekend.
31/08/15, 1:32 PM - Saleh: Greattt ideaa
31/08/15, 1:32 PM - Saleh: I m in
31/08/15, 1:32 PM - Ryan Shields: Redwings without Babcock tho
31/08/15, 1:33 PM - Kristov: If they want to see the REAL hockey experience we should take them when the Bruins play
31/08/15, 1:33 PM - Kristov: The dark side of Montreal will come out
31/08/15, 1:33 PM - Christian Gagne: Yes 👆
31/08/15, 1:33 PM - Angela Hernandez: That would be awesome!!! All I have seen is the oilers and honestly it was very disappointed
31/08/15, 1:34 PM - Rita Komarova: Yes! Amazing can't wait for hockeyyyy
31/08/15, 1:34 PM - Angela Hernandez: Disappointing
31/08/15, 1:34 PM - Ryan Shields: Jets on Sunday Nov 1
31/08/15, 1:34 PM - Ryan Shields: But now oilers have mcdavid
31/08/15, 1:35 PM - Christian Gagne: Think McDavid will make an immediate impact tho?
31/08/15, 1:35 PM - Karen Sidhu: Great idea! :)
31/08/15, 1:35 PM - Ryan Shields: Crosby did
31/08/15, 1:36 PM - Alex K: I'm in for hockey 👆🏼and especially if the red wings are in town
31/08/15, 1:36 PM - Christian Gagne: That's true
31/08/15, 1:36 PM - Christian Gagne: It'd be easy to highlight some games worth seeing.
31/08/15, 1:37 PM - Rita Komarova: Leafs vs Canadians will be intense as well
31/08/15, 1:37 PM - Christian Gagne: Hahaha yes!
31/08/15, 1:37 PM - Alex K: But the mtl Boston rivalry would probably be the better option
31/08/15, 1:37 PM - Alex K: Leafs are horrible
31/08/15, 1:37 PM - Rita Komarova: It's not about how good they are. Major rivalry
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Rita Komarova: And leafs are #1 most profitable team in nhl
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Alex K: It's also about how good they are
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Ryan Shields: Vs Washington dec 3 would be good but its a Thursday
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Christian Gagne: Lol
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Rita Komarova: Anyways we don't all have to go to the same game
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Rita Komarova: We can pick a few and ppl can decide which one thy prefer
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Alex K: The leafs have Babcock now though
31/08/15, 1:38 PM - Eric Galas: The last couple years Sens vs Habs has been really physical and lots of bad intentions
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Christian Gagne: Good point Erik
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: Go sens go!!!
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Christian Gagne: That's a good rivalry
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: I can wear my jersey
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Christian Gagne: Ugh Sens
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: Lol leafs fan
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: At least sens can make the playoffs!
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Christian Gagne: Habs*
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: Oh I see
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Alex K: When are the nordiques coming back - that was a good rivalry
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Rita Komarova: Lol
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Jayden: Canuckkksssss 😁
31/08/15, 1:39 PM - Ryan Shields: I'll wear my sens jersey if I have backup
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Alex K: You and Rita
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Rita Komarova: I got your back Ryan
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Christian Gagne: I'll wear my Raptors jersey

31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Ryan Shields: Thx Rita
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Eric Galas: Bring Das boot no one will mess with yoy
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Alex K: 😂
31/08/15, 1:40 PM - Rita Komarova: Hahaha I will
31/08/15, 1:41 PM - Rita Komarova: Last year a girl with sens jersey got beer spilled all over her by wonderful habs fan
31/08/15, 1:41 PM - Ryan Shields: Two girls
31/08/15, 1:41 PM - Rita Komarova: And then sens paid for her to come and sit in box with GM for next game
31/08/15, 1:41 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah and then a big fight broke out
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Ryan Shields: Now that's what I call a rivalry
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Rita Komarova: Yshhhh so we got Erik this year!
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Eric Galas: Telling you sens Habs bad intentions
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: No matter how bad the leafs are they always put up a good fight with the habs. So don't rule them out! A sens game should be great as well
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Alex K: This was in Montreal?
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Rita Komarova: Yah
31/08/15, 1:42 PM - Ryan Shields: Leafs will lose every game vs Montreal this year. You heard it here first
31/08/15, 1:43 PM - Rita Komarova: The probability of that happening i would say is 95%
31/08/15, 1:44 PM - Eric Galas: I'm jsut guaranteeing with 95% probability that there will be a fight
31/08/15, 1:44 PM - Alex K: I'm down for any game
31/08/15, 1:44 PM - Christian Gagne: Ditto
31/08/15, 1:45 PM - Ryan Shields: Even Phoenix?
31/08/15, 1:45 PM - Christian Gagne: Any Habs game in Montreal is an experience due to the crowd and the atmosphere
31/08/15, 1:45 PM - Alex K: Sure
31/08/15, 1:45 PM - Rita Komarova: Let's not get carried away here
31/08/15, 1:45 PM - Ryan Shields: Hahaha
31/08/15, 1:46 PM - Saleh: Guys one q abt something totally irrelevant
31/08/15, 1:46 PM - Saleh: Do we happen to hv the solutions to the book questions of stat ?
31/08/15, 1:47 PM - Saleh: I know at end are answers to even numbers. But how abt the solution
31/08/15, 1:47 PM - Christian Gagne: Check Base Camp materials under my courses for Statistics
31/08/15, 1:48 PM - Neha Karnad: That has stuff only for the normal ones.. Not for the A part though
31/08/15, 1:48 PM - Saleh: I am looking for the solution to 9.54
31/08/15, 1:50 PM - Sarah Lee: There are no "A" part solutions given out according to Hart
31/08/15, 1:53 PM - Saleh: Thx alot @christiane and neha
31/08/15, 2:02 PM - Alex K: Also, on the sports talk... For any football fans (not American) Didier Drogba now plays for the Montreal Impact (MLS). Could be an outing option as well...
31/08/15, 2:05 PM - Ryan Shields: How long does their season last?
31/08/15, 2:06 PM - Eric Galas: The impact also just fired their head coach so should be interesting what happens next
31/08/15, 2:07 PM - Alex K: Into late October I believe
31/08/15, 2:07 PM - Alex K: Erik, you should organize a CFL outing
31/08/15, 2:11 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah I will try... also jsut ran into a former classmate that was working for the Habs (not sure if she still is)  so I can reach out and see if she has any hookups or suggestions for a large group to go to a game
31/08/15, 2:11 PM - Alex K: Awesome 👌🏼. Keep us posted!
31/08/15, 2:13 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Love itttt! Thank you! Erik what was your idea about an McGill away game at Concordia? It sounded fun!
31/08/15, 2:15 PM - Eric Galas: Well there are a couple mcgill football game options since most games will be either at our stadium or at one of the other universities on the island so we can pick one(some have some historical significance)and join our crowd or go into enemy territory.  Let's get through this BT and figure it out after that
31/08/15, 2:19 PM - Ryan Shields: Sounds like fun
31/08/15, 2:19 PM - Deepti Kaul: For the hockey, Bruins vs habs is the best, most intense (I'm dying to go to one of those) but vs. sens has recently been heated and vs. leafs now because of Babcock is super interesting as well!!
31/08/15, 2:25 PM - Gul Kurtar: I can't follow all the messges but when and if we go to see a game count me in please
31/08/15, 2:28 PM - Vikram Hooda: 😃
31/08/15, 2:30 PM - Parker Donaldson: Hey everyone. Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow, the Department of Annuity and Income Surrendering Yield (The DAISY) will be collecting funds due from friday night. So if you partook in the BBBQ (the extra B is for BYOBB), then bring your $7.00 and surrender it to the DAISY. Or else.
31/08/15, 2:30 PM - Kristov: Who was talking smack about the oilers
31/08/15, 2:30 PM - Kristov: Only oilers fans are allowed to trash that team
31/08/15, 2:31 PM - Kristov: Also wow Parker you put a lot of work into that 👏
31/08/15, 2:35 PM - Parker Donaldson: Studying statistics is my muse.
31/08/15, 2:44 PM - Eric Galas: So working on the football games stuff (mcgill and Alouettes)and got the contact for the Habs group tickets person and my friend will help out if that doesn't go easily.   Could someone take the lead on setting up the Habs game for me and I can pass on the contact info? (can you tell I need a break from stats today)
31/08/15, 2:54 PM - Karen Sidhu: I can help you set it up Erik! Pass on the contact info and I can coordinate
31/08/15, 2:55 PM - Alex K: Karen, I can help as well.
31/08/15, 2:55 PM - Alex K: So let me know what you need once you get info from Erik.

01/09/15, 5:25 PM - Adnan Waheed: I feel like a lot of the stuff was generic that's been heard many, many times before.
01/09/15, 7:16 PM - Karen Sidhu: Hey everyone! I've been emailing with our contact at the Canadiens to organize a hockey game for our class. The group rate is 22 dollars which is very reasonable. It is a higher up section but that's where all the fun is anyways. Right now she is saying that in order to get regular season tickets we would also need to purchase tickets for the preseason. I just wanted to get a general consensus on who would be interested in a preseason game on either September 22 (vs. Toronto) 24 (vs. Washington), 25 (vs.chicago) or October 1 (vs.ottawa). If there is enough interest we can do both a preseason game and a regular season game and if not I can try to negotiate so we can get the same rate for just the one regular season game we had discussed earlier.
01/09/15, 7:20 PM - Yash Sinha: I wouldn't mind going for a preseason so that I can understand the actual game better when we go for that
01/09/15, 7:20 PM - LG Krishna Canada: What Yash said.
01/09/15, 7:21 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: I'm in for preseason if we can get a group of at least 10! Thank you Karen

01/09/15, 7:23 PM - Sohaib Bukhari: I'm most interested in the one against Toronto!
01/09/15, 7:23 PM - Sohaib Bukhari: Just because it's Toronto!
01/09/15, 7:24 PM - Rita Komarova: I'm interested in October 1 vs sens the most.
01/09/15, 7:25 PM - Rita Komarova: Then toronto then Chicago
01/09/15, 7:25 PM - Ryan Shields: Keep in mind too the later the preseason game the more likely better players suit up
01/09/15, 7:30 PM - Ali Akerman: I'm game either pre or regular season

03/09/15, 6:18 PM - Ryan Shields: Does anyone know if the stats textbook is available as an audio book so I can listen while I'm sleeping?
03/09/15, 6:27 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I admire you're dedication
03/09/15, 6:27 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: But would someone whispering numbers and formulas in your ear while you're sleeping help?
03/09/15, 6:29 PM - Ryan Shields: Worth a try
03/09/15, 6:31 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Just bring Yash or vivek home with you and have them read the textbook while you sleep
03/09/15, 6:31 PM - Yatin: Guys, pretty much everything we need to know about Stats is on Page 680
03/09/15, 6:32 PM - Yatin: If we do that passing is guaranteed...
03/09/15, 6:33 PM - Yash Sinha: Yes Nirros that's an amazing idea ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
03/09/15, 6:33 PM - Ryan Shields: Yatin is smart
03/09/15, 6:34 PM - Ryan Shields: Well if you guys are into it...

04/09/15, 9:17 AM - Deepti Kaul: Hey guys! Not sure if anyone will find this helpful/need this but there is a complete summary of chapters 12-19 in the appendix of chapter 19 (p. 816) that includes: all the formulas, when to use them, what their conditions are, etc. and it also includes the complete decision tree diagram to help you determine which statistical method to use that also includes the materials from chapters 17 and 18.
04/09/15, 9:18 AM - Mimi Orr: Thanks Deepti!
04/09/15, 9:18 AM - Mimi Orr: 🌟🌟🌟
04/09/15, 9:19 AM - Katya: Thank you, Deepti 👍🏻

04/09/15, 9:24 AM - Yatin: Just got mail for accounting assignment 2..
04/09/15, 9:25 AM - Yatin: Standard message dispersed to class : Well done 5/5
04/09/15, 9:28 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
04/09/15, 9:29 AM - Deepti Kaul: I got this as well: "Have a nice weekend and happy studying!"
04/09/15, 9:29 AM - Deepti Kaul: that almost seems a little mean
04/09/15, 9:30 AM - Katya: Or cheering :)
04/09/15, 9:41 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
04/09/15, 9:43 AM - Angela Hernandez: I have just found out there are certain brands and models for the allowed calculators if any one is interested in the McGill website
04/09/15, 9:44 AM - Deepti Kaul: Can you please send the link of where you found this?
04/09/15, 9:46 AM - Angela Hernandez: I am not sure if it applies (maybe someone in class can confirm) but this is the web page: http://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/current-students/undergraduate/courses-registration/exams-assessment/faculty-standard-calculators
04/09/15, 9:46 AM - Angela Hernandez: Guillaume was the one that told me but I don't know
04/09/15, 9:47 AM - Deepti Kaul: I believe this policy is McGill-wide
04/09/15, 9:54 AM - Eric Galas: https://www.mcgill.ca/students/exams/regulations  

different for engineering than other faculties. Not sure though if my Texas instrument BA I I Plus is acceptable
04/09/15, 9:56 AM - Deepti Kaul: Yeah it just says "Non text storing"
04/09/15, 9:56 AM - Deepti Kaul: I don't even know if my calculator can store text lol
04/09/15, 9:58 AM - Sumeet Singh: Considering that the exam is open book... I'm not sure if the "no text storing calculators" policy applies here
04/09/15, 9:59 AM - Chiren Shah: Agree Sumeet 👍
04/09/15, 10:00 AM - Katya: "Non-programmable" is also a question. TI BA II Plus runs cash flow modeling - is this programmable?... I don't remember who decides whether the particular models are applicable. Prof. Hart?
04/09/15, 10:04 AM - Yash Sinha: You can't store text on the BA II Plus so it should be fine
04/09/15, 10:05 AM - Ryan Shields: I agree with yash
04/09/15, 10:06 AM - Eric Galas: Thanks all!
04/09/15, 10:09 AM - Angela Hernandez: The note about the type of calculator is in the front page of the example exam
04/09/15, 11:17 AM - Yatin: Does anyone know where can I get hold of one of the free calculators people were talking about? I am stingy...

04/09/15, 5:19 PM - Sumeet Singh: If not for the fact that no guy would want to go to such an event

07/09/15, 10:54 AM - Caroline: I would be surprised.... But I am not the best person to answer u
07/09/15, 10:54 AM - Caroline: Brofman is open thou
07/09/15, 10:55 AM - Ali Akerman: Georgette said she was doing a session but not sure of the details
07/09/15, 10:57 AM - Caroline: No idea, sorry. Maybe someone else will know.
07/09/15, 11:03 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Georgette will be tutoring from 6:30 onwards
07/09/15, 11:04 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: At bronfman in one of the classrooms on the 3rd floor!
07/09/15, 11:05 AM - Angela Hernandez: Is it open? They sent an email saying it was going to be closed
07/09/15, 11:06 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: It's a misleading email
07/09/15, 11:06 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: I double checked with sujata. You just need your ID to get in
07/09/15, 11:07 AM - Ali Akerman: Yep that's true. I also asked the security on Friday. You can get in with your ID.
07/09/15, 11:08 AM - Ali Akerman: Someone will have to let georgette in btw. I'll most likely be there but she doesn't have my number
07/09/15, 11:08 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: @ali is it ok if I give her your number through rohan?
07/09/15, 11:11 AM - Ali Akerman: Sure no problem, I'll probably head there within the hour anyways

07/09/15, 11:12 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: It will....
07/09/15, 11:13 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: And when it does you will feel like shouting the right  answers to yourself like a crazy person
07/09/15, 11:14 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Advice from Ximena: Bring earplugs or head phones so we don't get distracted from each other!
07/09/15, 11:16 AM - Katya: Good advice, thanks
07/09/15, 11:16 AM - Ali Akerman: Hahahahahaha eventually I hope. Ear plugs are a good idea but do you think they'd let us have headphones during an exam?
07/09/15, 11:18 AM - Parker Donaldson: So we aren't distracted from Natasha shouting the right answers to herself during the exam.
07/09/15, 11:19 AM - Parker Donaldson: DIFFERENCE OF TWO POPULATION MEANS!!!
07/09/15, 11:19 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: 😎.
07/09/15, 11:19 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: HEY GUYS I GET IT!
07/09/15, 11:21 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Dunno, ximena said to being headphones,  it may have been a translation error and she meant earplugs (I added that part to her recommendation)
07/09/15, 11:21 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I'm pretty sure headphones aren't allowed
07/09/15, 11:21 AM - Ali Akerman: Hahaha if you're shouting out the right answers I'll be all ears during the exam 😂😂😂
07/09/15, 12:51 PM - Yash Sinha: On a related note, can we carry granola bars or chocolates into the exam hall and eat them there?
07/09/15, 12:52 PM - Mimi Orr: In law school we have 3 hour exams and can bring in food that does not make noise (ie not crackers) and as long as they are in a clear plastic ziploc
07/09/15, 12:53 PM - Mimi Orr: And taken out of their wrapper

11/09/15, 10:05 AM - Karen Sidhu: Hey everyone! So as you know I've been trying to organize the group tickets for a Montreal canadiens game. I've been having some difficulty connecting with the coordinator for group sales but she finally just got back to me with some more information. It turns out we misinterpreted the group rate and we are unable to get the 22 tickets but she was able to help us out by waiving the requirement to purchase two sets of tickets so now we are able to just get one set of tickets for $56 dollars each. Due to high demand the only game she can accommodate us for is on Saturday October 17 and it is facing the Detroit red wings; it seems to fit our schedule well so hopefully this works out for everyone. I am going to send out a google sign up sheet now to the mcgill mba Google group. Since regular ticket sales start tomorrow it is really important that if you would like to sign up you do so by this afternoon. I just need to get her a number today and then we can figure out the other logistics. I'm so sorry for the short notice and lack of flexibility but hopefully this works for everyone! It's going to be a lot of fun 🇨🇦
11/09/15, 10:12 AM - Adam Cappabianca: Thanks Karen!!

Then, every ten seconds, they walked toward each other until they were half the previous distance apart.

A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were asked, "When will the girls and boys meet?"

The mathematician said: "Never."

The physicist said: "In an infinite amount of time."

The engineer said: "Well... in about two minutes, they'll be close enough for all practical purposes."

15/09/15, 10:45 PM - Eric Galas: Sure could be done anytime really not too much prep other than dividing teams, judging and ingredients/country. .. we could always ask the MBA office staff to be the judges and have it be a way to thank them closer to the holiday season
15/09/15, 10:47 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Myah! Nice end to the semester. We should ask sujata to arrange the groups. ☺

21/09/15, 5:53 PM - Yatin: Hi guys, is it just me or does our outward train journey for the Toronto trip clash with our value creation exam on 11Nov?
21/09/15, 5:53 PM - LG Krishna Canada: It doesn't I think
21/09/15, 5:53 PM - Ryan Shields: It doesn't
21/09/15, 5:54 PM - Yatin: Isn't value creation exam supposed to be 1-4 on 11nov?
21/09/15, 5:54 PM - Ryan Shields: Administration already saw conflict per Christian
21/09/15, 5:54 PM - Ryan Shields: Exam is 10am now I think

21/09/15, 9:37 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: ;)
21/09/15, 10:23 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I am doing the readings and found something funny. If you think about IT being just 'it' changes the meaning if the whole text.

22/09/15, 3:05 PM - Yash Sinha: @Neha- Is this legit and latest?
22/09/15, 3:14 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey a general question regarding  the calculation of the EAC in question 8, do you take into account taxes into the cost or not? ( in class he did not, on most examples on the internet they do)
22/09/15, 4:00 PM - Neha Karnad: It's on our mycourses
22/09/15, 4:00 PM - Scott Fulton: I did because it says they are completely depreciated ie would be taxed
22/09/15, 4:16 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Thx man
22/09/15, 4:26 PM - Rita Komarova: Hi everyone! I wanted to remind you that the MBA1 Representative Debate for DGSS is tomorrow during lunch 12-1pm in room 360. I am running to be your representative so if you'd like to talk to me about anything between now and voting days (September 26 and 27), please let me know! Also, you will have an opportunity to ask questions tomorrow at the debates so think of something good!
22/09/15, 5:20 PM - Parker Donaldson: I think there exists a direct correlation between who is elected and who provides pizza during the debate...
22/09/15, 5:21 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I agree with Parker
22/09/15, 5:32 PM - Yash Sinha: I think the correlation is stronger with oysters
22/09/15, 5:48 PM - Ankit Balyan: I think the correlation is so strong ... It borders on causation 😂
22/09/15, 5:49 PM - Parker Donaldson: Btw they're giving away free pizza away at brigade on stanley. 1 year anniversery.
22/09/15, 5:49 PM - Parker Donaldson: Like right now. I'm now in line
22/09/15, 5:59 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: So the direct correlation mainly applies to you Parker. Good to know.
22/09/15, 6:10 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: So Rita hope you're taking notes, pizza guarantees Parkers vote. And a tour of the Olympic stadium gets you Guillaumes vote.
22/09/15, 6:16 PM - Rita Komarova: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
22/09/15, 6:19 PM - Parker Donaldson: <Media omitted>
22/09/15, 6:19 PM - Parker Donaldson: Free build your own pizza
22/09/15, 6:21 PM - Karen Sidhu: Omg yum
22/09/15, 6:21 PM - Karen Sidhu: How long is the line?
22/09/15, 6:24 PM - Parker Donaldson: Expect 30 min wait time.
22/09/15, 6:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: .Over.
22/09/15, 6:28 PM - Parker Donaldson: <Media omitted>
22/09/15, 6:36 PM - Rita Komarova: Amazing!
22/09/15, 6:39 PM - Christian Gagne: Pesto 👌🏼
22/09/15, 8:15 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Guys, today when I went to the help desk in the basement of Desautels to ask to book a room either in the basement or in the second floor. I was told that those rooms are only for undergrads and that the third floor is for MBAs. I don't know about you guys but I don't like being told to stay in a certain area of the building when we pay a large amount in tuition. I wanted to bring it up with Sujata but I wanted to see if anyone else uses the facilities in the second floor and in the basement. Thanks :)
22/09/15, 8:16 PM - Yash Sinha: The undergrads are also coming along on the Toronto trip
22/09/15, 8:20 PM - Gul Kurtar: Whaaaat!?
22/09/15, 8:20 PM - Parker Donaldson: 😍
22/09/15, 8:20 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Yes, turns out its not an MBA only event.
22/09/15, 8:21 PM - Parker Donaldson: Joking! Totally joking. That kind of makes sense. The 4th years will be looking for jobs too.
22/09/15, 8:21 PM - Parker Donaldson: They're hungry for work too.
22/09/15, 8:21 PM - Gul Kurtar: I'm sushing now
22/09/15, 8:22 PM - Gul Kurtar: No comments
22/09/15, 8:22 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Is no one else pissed about this?
22/09/15, 8:22 PM - Angela Hernandez: We are all but is out of our hands
22/09/15, 8:30 PM - Christian Gagne: It's ridiculous but what recourse do we have
22/09/15, 8:31 PM - Yash Sinha: Ermm get in touch with our DGSS rep and have them communicate our concerns to the admin staff
22/09/15, 8:32 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Wait a minute
22/09/15, 8:32 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: How about my concern
22/09/15, 8:32 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😢
22/09/15, 8:32 PM - Scott Fulton: Ahh no worries the undergrad pylons don't know how to network. If anything they'll make us look even better haha
22/09/15, 8:32 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I don't care about the Toronto trip 😅
22/09/15, 8:35 PM - Ali Akerman: I didn't know about the meeting rooms but I made an appointment with Don on Thursday to discuss this Toronto situation
22/09/15, 8:35 PM - Ali Akerman: I can bring the meeting rooms up too.
22/09/15, 8:36 PM - Ali Akerman: Or you're welcome to come to the meeting with me
22/09/15, 8:36 PM - Gul Kurtar: Both issues are important but toronto>classes in current situation
22/09/15, 8:38 PM - Ali Akerman: I also don't appreciate not being differentiated from undergrads when it works out in their favor but being limited to the 3rd floor as if we were squatting their building
22/09/15, 8:40 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I'll come with you mr .A
22/09/15, 8:40 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: What time?
22/09/15, 8:41 PM - Ali Akerman: Sounds great. Don't know what time yet. He's out of office till then so he'll get back to me.
22/09/15, 8:41 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Sounds good
22/09/15, 8:44 PM - Christian Gagne: We need that new building!
22/09/15, 8:48 PM - Bryan Au: Or at least a dedicated elevator
22/09/15, 9:02 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Hi Nirros, I think that the number of undergrads is way more than MBA students, fifth floor is dedicated to PhD students and there is no class on sixth floor. It leaves them with only basement and second floor. I kind of think that they are right to ask us to plan our activities mainly on third floor and I have heard before that they are actually looking for another building because they don't have enough space, but till....
Sorry Nirros😉I support you in your other claims though😁
22/09/15, 9:17 PM - Vincent Lee: There's 2300 undergrads on 4 floors. And 200 or so MBA students on one floor. In reality, they should be bitching about us.
22/09/15, 9:20 PM - Gul Kurtar: In reality we should have out own building for 80k
22/09/15, 9:20 PM - Gul Kurtar: Our*
22/09/15, 9:25 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: @Sarah...I didn't make any other claims 😒
22/09/15, 9:27 PM - Ali Akerman: No I'm sorry but they shouldn't be complaining. It's not like we are in "their" building or anything
22/09/15, 9:29 PM - Parker Donaldson: "Let them eat cake."
22/09/15, 9:31 PM - Sara Mahabadi: I meant future claims😉@Nirros
22/09/15, 9:35 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😍
22/09/15, 10:02 PM - Rita Komarova: It's true, our own building would be amazing! However, at the moment we just need to work with what we have....I think the best would be to encourage our MBA administration to move along with the project to move into the bookstore building as soon as possible. In addition, keep in mind that the library near the bookstore is a great resource for good room bookings. 👍🏻
22/09/15, 10:05 PM - Gul Kurtar: Still. Toronto trip with undergrads?...
22/09/15, 10:08 PM - Rita Komarova: Agreed, not the best situation. Ali, please let us know the outcome of your conversation with Don.
22/09/15, 10:11 PM - Kristov: The undergrads can come and be our executive assistants
22/09/15, 10:13 PM - Gul Kurtar: Bet you'd love it kristov :)
22/09/15, 10:13 PM - Parker Donaldson: "Undergrad! I said tie me a double windsor! Not a single! Now empty my bed pan."
22/09/15, 10:13 PM - Yash Sinha: Bed pan?
22/09/15, 10:13 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Maybe some military reference 😁
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Parker Donaldson: Lol. Chamber pot. Whatever!
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Gul Kurtar: Pot you piss in
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Gul Kurtar: 😁
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Aka puke tupperware
22/09/15, 10:14 PM - Yash Sinha: I don't think it's only piss
22/09/15, 10:15 PM - Gul Kurtar: 🙈
22/09/15, 10:17 PM - Ali Akerman: Will definitely update you guys. Again the goal here isn't to prevent them from coming or get into a useless argument but we want to make sure that this trip, as intended, is primarily focused on our career objectives and the undergrads aren't suddenly brought forward to the foreground at our expense. 
Also, another point would be to point out that this isn't a high school expedition with set hotels and one way train tickets. The initiative is good as an option but many of us feel the travel and sleep accommodations shouldn't be mandatory. 
I sometimes feel they forget that we all have been through those stages in life and aren't kids anymore.
22/09/15, 10:20 PM - Gul Kurtar: Exactly!
22/09/15, 10:21 PM - Ryan Shields: Well said Ali
22/09/15, 10:22 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Well said Ali and Ryan
22/09/15, 10:24 PM - Bryan Au: I've been working on my ninja chop. Undergrads better get out of the way if they don't wanna get hurt.
22/09/15, 10:26 PM - Ali Akerman: Hahahaha we will unleash the fury of Bryan 😂
22/09/15, 10:27 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Bryan..you're the one that told me girls lift more than you at your gym
22/09/15, 10:28 PM - Bryan Au: Ninja chop trumps everything. It's the most important lesson from the MBA. Pay attention in class
22/09/15, 10:29 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I was just looking out for you...last thing we want is for the undergrads to beat up an Mba student
22/09/15, 10:29 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Looks bad on us
22/09/15, 10:35 PM - Caroline: 😂
22/09/15, 10:45 PM - Ryan Shields: That's why we have "yoga classes"
23/09/15, 8:21 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Shit, I posted in the wrong thread!
23/09/15, 8:22 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Fuck.
23/09/15, 8:22 AM - Christian Gagne: 😅
23/09/15, 8:22 AM - Christian Gagne: Or did you Guillaume
23/09/15, 8:22 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Seriously.
23/09/15, 8:23 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Morning fuzziness.
23/09/15, 8:23 AM - Parker Donaldson: Nah. That was a serendipitous outcome. Supported from mba2s.
23/09/15, 8:23 AM - LG Krishna Canada: Maybe we should just 'accidentally' delete the other thread and then say 'Whoops. Too much effort to form another group. Let's just leave it be'
23/09/15, 8:24 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Nah. I'll let it be.. Whatever.. It could have been worse..haha
23/09/15, 8:27 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: At least I got an answer to what I asked. I wasn't sure what the problem was about undergrad coming. Now I understand a bit more.
23/09/15, 8:30 AM - Ryan Shields: It should be fine to have differing opinions and ask questions anyways
23/09/15, 8:32 AM - Yash Sinha: Yeah but it's just that text as a media is prone to misinterpretation, especially by people who don't know you fairly well

23/09/15, 10:54 AM - Andrew Mutrie: Guys key point: how many undergrads are coming? If it is a select few, they may add to the trip. Let's wait until we have all the facts and viewpoints before we become embittered.
23/09/15, 10:56 AM - Alex K: <Media omitted>
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Rita Komarova: Lol
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Ryan Shields: I like the picture because the kids are leaning forward to go in for the handshake
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Ryan Shields: They need to work on their eyebrows
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Alex K: Scott will teach them the eye brow move
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Alex K: He's an expert
23/09/15, 10:57 AM - Ryan Shields: But maybe that's an MBA level technique

24/09/15, 8:51 AM - Alex K: The guy was from Pigeon Forge. If anyone has ever been, it's one of the most redneck places in the U.S. Confederate flags everywhere and home of Dollywood. I wouldn't focus on that quote because...
24/09/15, 8:54 AM - Alex K: Of one guy and pin that train of thought on people. Statistics are malleable especially when you're polling or interviewing people from places like pigeon forge. Not sure if there's an analogous place anywhere else in the world to give you a better understanding of how things work there.

24/09/15, 1:21 PM - Ali Akerman: Ok guys so we've met very briefly with Don about some of the concerns and we will book a meeting with MJ very soon. 

For space in the building, it turns out that basement was a compromise made to the BComm program so we can have our 3rd floor space. They have priority there. The 2nd floor  however is a shared space so we are entitled to use it as needed.

For the Toronto trip, Career Services is handling everything and the MBA office doesn't have many details on it. They do share our concerns and assured us that at we would be taken care of in terms of meetings and time allocated with recruiters. 

For further details about the logistics, we'll contact MJ and get back to you.
24/09/15, 1:21 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Ali, thank you so much!

24/09/15, 7:41 PM - Rita Komarova: Hi guys, so Ali and I spoke to MJ today and it was a really productive meeting. Here are some key takeaways:
- deadline for Toronto trip has been extended to September 30 
- an info session on the trip will be held with career services on Monday, September 28 at 4:15 (you can ask any questions about the trip then)
- information on that will be sent out tomorrow
- toronto trip will have a total of 125 people going, this includes MBAs, staff and the rest are carefully selected undergrads
- the breakfast, lunches and most sessions will actually be in separate locations for undergrads and MBAs
- the $250 includes the train there, the hotel, lunches and cocktails at the alumni event (career services is actually subsidizing a big part so the cost is less for us)

Ali, did I forget anything??

02/10/15, 1:20 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Not sure what I am cooking.  That is part of the offering actually.
02/10/15, 1:34 PM - Gaurav McGill: <Media omitted>

02/10/15, 2:52 PM - Sara Mahabadi: 👍🏻
02/10/15, 2:53 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Looks delicious. Who decided we have only one lunch per day?
02/10/15, 3:01 PM - Rita Komarova: Guysss we need ppl to sign up for Turkey for Friendsgiving! Particularly the Canadians. I'll take one but I can't do more.
02/10/15, 3:07 PM - Christian Gagne: I'll gladly team up with someone and help? My oven is out of commission though at the moment. I can supply a 🐔 if someone's got the tools.
02/10/15, 3:09 PM - Rita Komarova: whoever signs up on the same line can split the cost
02/10/15, 3:23 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: I'm on Turkey
02/10/15, 4:40 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey, one of my friend (actually a former/current business partner) is preparing to pitch to some VCs, and is looking for some people to get feed back and some tough questions. I would get him to pitch in one of the rooms next week or the following (better) anyone interested watching the presentation?
02/10/15, 4:43 PM - Anurag McGill: I am in
02/10/15, 4:43 PM - Christian Gagne: I'm interested as well
02/10/15, 4:44 PM - LG Krishna Canada: McGill Shark Tank!
02/10/15, 4:44 PM - Ankit Balyan: Sure.. Me too
02/10/15, 4:44 PM - Christian Gagne: This poor guy is going to have the whole MBA1 cohort poking holes in his idea
02/10/15, 4:44 PM - Anurag McGill: I think u can talk to george from entrepreneurship club they would love to arrange for him
02/10/15, 4:45 PM - Eric Galas: I would be interested
02/10/15, 4:45 PM - Anurag McGill: He can find some VC too ... i guess
02/10/15, 4:45 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: me too!
02/10/15, 4:45 PM - Anurag McGill: For practice
02/10/15, 4:46 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Sure. Haha. Basically he is partnering up with this Cambridge PhD that worked on small scale wind turbines in UK.  And they think they found the market for that.
02/10/15, 4:47 PM - Christian Gagne: Cool
02/10/15, 4:47 PM - Christian Gagne: Have they sized the market?
02/10/15, 4:49 PM - Neha Karnad: +1
02/10/15, 4:49 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: But I have also two friends that I want to have them to do a presentation of their respective companies. One is the president of Rise Kombucha, and the other the COO of S-sence (online clothing company) they are both from Montreal and exceptional in what they did. What would be the best way to have them come?
02/10/15, 4:50 PM - Christian Gagne: Maybe ask the Entrepreneurship department or Dobson Lagasee Centre
02/10/15, 4:50 PM - Christian Gagne: Entrepreneurship Club as well
02/10/15, 4:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I think the market is 500 millions or something, but they pivot around diesel displacement and smart load management ideas as well.
02/10/15, 4:52 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Good. I will try to organise something. Bassel from Ssense did something incredible with IT, they don't have a IT department per say, it's just integrated in every department of the company. He started with his brother about 10 years ago and they have 200+ employees now.
02/10/15, 4:57 PM - Gul Kurtar: I'd be interested in s-sence presentation
02/10/15, 4:57 PM - Sumeet Singh: The COO of ssence is your friend?
02/10/15, 4:57 PM - Sumeet Singh: I like ssence
02/10/15, 4:58 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: https://www.ssense.com/
02/10/15, 4:58 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Can I take the role of the narrator for this episode of McGill Shark Tank?
02/10/15, 4:59 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I misspelled the first time. Yes his a good friend we did high school and engineering school together. Very humble and funny guy.
02/10/15, 4:59 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha mcgill shark tank. Just don't make him cry
02/10/15, 4:59 PM - Gul Kurtar: It showed up on google search anyway
02/10/15, 5:01 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Nobody knows about Rise Kombucha?
02/10/15, 5:06 PM - Sarah Lee: Fermented tea
02/10/15, 5:06 PM - Sarah Lee: I've seen their product
02/10/15, 5:07 PM - Sarah Lee: Have not tried! But would love to  😀
02/10/15, 5:07 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's actually great to know that so little people know what Kombucha is! It's a 1G$ market in north america only, set grow at 30G$ in ten years.
02/10/15, 5:08 PM - Scott Fulton: Haha cuz only Sara knows?? Therefore little people?
02/10/15, 5:08 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha.
02/10/15, 5:09 PM - Sarah Lee: Its still relatively new to the market and most ppl who know about it are "heath conscious" / natural health consumers
02/10/15, 5:09 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I make sure he brings some cases when he comes.
02/10/15, 5:09 PM - Sarah Lee: There are a couple other brands that I've tried
02/10/15, 5:09 PM - Sarah Lee: Yah! 😊
02/10/15, 5:09 PM - Sarah Lee: Sell them at yoga and spin studios!
02/10/15, 5:10 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yeah that what is wonderful for him, it's such a nice product, in a market can only grow!
02/10/15, 5:10 PM - Sarah Lee: Or pop up shops at high end department stores! Lots of juice companies do that
02/10/15, 5:12 PM - Katya: I would be interested in the ssence presentation either
02/10/15, 5:12 PM - Saleh: Oo guillaume i am in. I am actully interested in ssence
02/10/15, 5:12 PM - Saleh: I am in for all 😎
02/10/15, 5:12 PM - Gul Kurtar: Bring the ssense guy in!
02/10/15, 5:13 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hehe ok, I'll organize something.
02/10/15, 5:13 PM - Saleh: Are thy looking gor vc or cv ?
02/10/15, 5:13 PM - Saleh: 😜
02/10/15, 5:13 PM - Saleh: For*
02/10/15, 5:14 PM - LG Krishna Canada: 14 sharks. 1 presentation. Will this entrepreneur get a deal of a lifetime or walkaway empty handed. Stay tuned for McGill Shark Tank. (Cue ominous music)
02/10/15, 5:15 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha. No ssence is not looking for vc. It would just be a ' look at what amazing things I did without an mba' kinda thing.
02/10/15, 5:15 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: But yes they look for cv. But mainly senior it guys I think and some in marketing.
02/10/15, 5:15 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I should ask him actually.
02/10/15, 5:16 PM - Saleh: Bring him on. We will show him what amazing things he could have done with mba 😃
02/10/15, 5:16 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hehe
02/10/15, 5:17 PM - Sumeet Singh: 😄😄
02/10/15, 5:23 PM - Parker Donaldson: Can we finance him with our student debts?
02/10/15, 5:24 PM - Parker Donaldson: Leverage with our low rate student lines of credits?
02/10/15, 5:26 PM - Yatin: We can pool our debts together issue some securities and fund home with it :)
02/10/15, 5:27 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
02/10/15, 5:33 PM - Parker Donaldson: Hey nataSha! Can you tell A-Aron that I am challenging him on a stuffing cook off. To be judged by an impartial MBA2. And the loser has to complete a challenge that #drunkkaren comes up with near the end of the night?
02/10/15, 5:35 PM - Parker Donaldson: Of course i'm very much going to lose. But it's
The commitment and consistency method of persuasion
02/10/15, 5:39 PM - Alex K: Haha you used the #drunkkaren hash. It's catching on

02/10/15, 5:45 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Prepare for pretentious SF statement:  Aaron and I were curious about selling some at home and homemade stuff at the house!!
02/10/15, 5:46 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Whoa typos...
02/10/15, 5:52 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha too much energy for two poor thumbs!
02/10/15, 6:07 PM - Eric Galas: Shane Murphy is awesome!  If you like live music go for it!
02/10/15, 6:13 PM - Gul Kurtar: What time today matt?

03/10/15, 1:32 PM - Saleh: Tens of thousands of protesters marched in Montreal and Quebec City's streets in protest against the Couillard government's belt-tightening.

They protested austerity measures introduced by Philippe Couillard's government, including fee restructuring for the province's subsidized daycare program, and cuts to medical care, social services and education.
03/10/15, 2:00 PM - Kristov: Quebec, a "have not" province
03/10/15, 2:09 PM - Saleh: Kris what u mean ?
03/10/15, 2:10 PM - Kristov: Quebec has bloated public spending and receives equalization payments from other provinces to support it
03/10/15, 2:11 PM - Saleh: Ooo
03/10/15, 2:11 PM - Saleh: Realy
03/10/15, 2:13 PM - Kristov: Yeah. It receives almost as much as every other province that currently receives equalization payments combined.
03/10/15, 2:13 PM - Kristov: About 8 billion, last I checked.
03/10/15, 2:13 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>

03/10/15, 2:50 PM - Gaurav McGill: Message*
03/10/15, 2:53 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I did not see any free food when they were preparing the protest in the jeanne-meance park. But there was heavy logistics for the rest (flags, signs, etc).

07/10/15, 9:04 AM - Abhinav Vaish: 👍
07/10/15, 10:41 AM - Angela Hernandez: Not sure if everyone heard it in class or not but the OB prof. Said the highest mark was 87 so in order to make that a 100 everyone gets 13 points more
07/10/15, 10:41 AM - Angela Hernandez: I asked after class and he confirmed
07/10/15, 10:42 AM - Angela Hernandez: I know there are some groups super worried about it
07/10/15, 10:43 AM - Gul Kurtar: Thank you angela
07/10/15, 10:45 AM - Saranya: Thanks Angela
07/10/15, 10:48 AM - Jahnavi Canada: Thanks Angela :)
07/10/15, 11:05 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: So the average is now 82%?
07/10/15, 11:06 AM - Kristov: To whoever got 87...why u make us look bad
07/10/15, 11:23 AM - Deepti Kaul: This is for the integrative case entirely or just the OB portion?
07/10/15, 11:23 AM - Christian Gagne: Assuming just OB
07/10/15, 11:24 AM - Irene Xue: Ya just OB portion is handed out so far
07/10/15, 11:26 AM - Daisy: Did they mention when we get the IS and finance ?
07/10/15, 11:26 AM - Caroline: Respective review sessions I believe
07/10/15, 11:28 AM - Deepti Kaul: Ah perfect! Thank you!
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Aiya: Will Brain post a sample OB answer that would earn 100%? I am curious how we can learn the best out of this experience.
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Deepti Kaul: Yeah that would be helpful...
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Scott Fulton: Type 2 learning! Haha
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Scott Fulton: OB irony
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Scott Fulton: No blame...only why
07/10/15, 11:36 AM - Ankit Balyan: Yeah.. That would be helpful
07/10/15, 11:38 AM - Yash Sinha: When I asked him he said that there was no perfect answer and it depended on how you applied the tactic you'd chosen to pursue... Like for one of the answers our tactic was suboptimal but he didn't dock any points for not using a better tactic because we explained our strategy well enough
07/10/15, 11:46 AM - Aiya: Thanks Yash! This sheds some light. Still it is interesting to see his expectation of a perfect explanation to "how" question. I might stay for his next OB review session
07/10/15, 11:49 AM - Yatin: My general experience with 'OB type' subjective exams...Firstly, you will never score the full marks, second because of highly subjective nature you can only do your best and hope probability will take care of the rest..It is a single loop learning response..but then - 'Why take the hard road?' If you're know what I mean..
07/10/15, 12:14 PM - Kristov: Anyone having problems logging into mymcgill?

07/10/15, 3:46 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Good persuasive "no" Veronica!
07/10/15, 4:55 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey, I spoke to a couple of us and I was thinking of going to do some hicking at mont st-hilaire. It's 40 min south, and we could go just after the brunch. It's about 50 min walk up the mountain and the view is really nice. Especially that the colours are starting to show. Anyone interested?
07/10/15, 4:57 PM - Gul Kurtar: Which day is this thing
07/10/15, 4:57 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I was thinking Saturday
07/10/15, 5:00 PM - Karen Sidhu: Yah that sounds fun!
07/10/15, 5:01 PM - Sumeet Singh: ☝
07/10/15, 5:03 PM - Angela Hernandez: I am in!
07/10/15, 5:03 PM - Kristov: Count me in!
07/10/15, 5:10 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Just confused about the brunch. It's saturday or sunday?
07/10/15, 5:10 PM - Angela Hernandez: Sunday
07/10/15, 5:10 PM - Angela Hernandez: I think
07/10/15, 5:11 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Brunch is Sunday Guillaume

07/10/15, 5:53 PM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>
07/10/15, 5:57 PM - Gul Kurtar: Nice plan. I'll pass though. Have fun "hicking" guys
07/10/15, 5:59 PM - Samira Khajehi: We can brunch on Saturday instead. There was consideration that no one would make it to brunch after partying MR away
07/10/15, 6:01 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: I'm probably one of those people who won't survive Friday night to make it for brunch on sat
07/10/15, 6:02 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: I know I just state the obvious
07/10/15, 6:02 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: *stated
07/10/15, 6:02 PM - Gul Kurtar: Some wisdom vivek 😛
07/10/15, 6:04 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Brunch saturday and hike sunday? Brunch is the best medecine against hangover

07/10/15, 6:16 PM - Gul Kurtar: I am a seagull
07/10/15, 6:19 PM - Odilon: I am in for the hicking also!
07/10/15, 6:29 PM - Sarah Lee: I just want to clarify that the proper way to spell it
07/10/15, 6:29 PM - Sarah Lee: 😛
07/10/15, 6:29 PM - Gul Kurtar: Hahaha
07/10/15, 6:32 PM - Sumeet Singh: ..is hciking
07/10/15, 6:32 PM - Sumeet Singh: The c is silent
07/10/15, 6:33 PM - Gul Kurtar: Lool
07/10/15, 6:33 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Like Lool with the second O being silent?
07/10/15, 6:33 PM - Gul Kurtar: Lul
07/10/15, 6:34 PM - Yash Sinha: Hicking = to hiccup 
Hiking = to hike
07/10/15, 6:34 PM - Gul Kurtar: Good guy yash
07/10/15, 6:34 PM - Yash Sinha: 😁
07/10/15, 6:34 PM - LG Krishna Canada: The Yash

07/10/15, 6:35 PM - Sumeet Singh: Heyy... Who's to say hicking is not the fine art of making hickeys
07/10/15, 6:35 PM - Sarah Lee: Yes!
07/10/15, 6:35 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Sooo hicking is not how you spell it?
07/10/15, 6:35 PM - Yash Sinha: Hickeying
07/10/15, 6:36 PM - Eric Galas: That's a keeper... being a good person or performing a kind act.  #Yashing
07/10/15, 6:36 PM - Yash Sinha: 😳

07/10/15, 7:34 PM - Saleh: ye
07/10/15, 7:59 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: I have went to a previous presentation for winter prep...
The main messages are:
-Be ready to live with massive amounts  of snow
-Do not cheap out on a coat and on boots
07/10/15, 8:00 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: =) thank you!
07/10/15, 8:02 PM - Saleh: tht is it ?!
07/10/15, 8:09 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Yeah... They also tell us to keep active. Participating in winter sports and outdoor activities. 
Properly dressed, obviously.

07/10/15, 8:14 PM - Katya: <Media omitted>

07/10/15, 8:40 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
07/10/15, 8:45 PM - Angela Hernandez: I know it sounds dumb but I got a little depressed on my first winter here, I kept it in silence and when I told a friend she told me it was normal and that I needed to take vitamins and exercise...the next year I did that and, even when it could have been the placebo effect, I think it worked
07/10/15, 8:45 PM - Saleh: @rodrigo thx
07/10/15, 8:45 PM - Angela Hernandez: So don't ignore the sports advice
07/10/15, 8:46 PM - Angela Hernandez: And I agree, is worth buying 1 good jacket and 1 good pair of boots than several of low quality
07/10/15, 8:47 PM - Scott Fulton: Not dumb at all! Winter doldrums are real. It's hard to get out, stay active etc. When it's -100 and dark at 5.
07/10/15, 8:47 PM - Eric Galas: The depressive feelings are very common over the winter as well as the recommendation to take vitamins
07/10/15, 8:48 PM - Yash Sinha: Which vitamins exactly?
07/10/15, 8:48 PM - Scott Fulton: I'd say get a multivitamin
07/10/15, 8:49 PM - Scott Fulton: Costco's are quite good
07/10/15, 8:49 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Lol.. Yash.. Vitamin J. Vitamin Jameson.
07/10/15, 8:49 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: angela, your recommendation for sports is one i will take to heart. would help with winter doldrums, mba stress, $$ stress.
07/10/15, 8:50 PM - Angela Hernandez: Oh yeah! It works lots, I used to do yoga 5 times a week and swimming at least twice, it seriously help
07/10/15, 8:51 PM - Saleh: @yash
07/10/15, 8:51 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Cross country skiing on the mont royal, skating. You need to hold on to the few vitamins D the sun is giving you
07/10/15, 8:51 PM - Saleh: something lik this
07/10/15, 8:51 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
07/10/15, 8:52 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah multi vitamin or I know people which take vitamin C and D supplements
07/10/15, 8:55 PM - Angela Hernandez: Maybe @Sarah Lee can recommend any?
07/10/15, 8:55 PM - Angela Hernandez: Not sure if that is still on your field of expertise
07/10/15, 8:56 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: whoa, i have a lot to do!
07/10/15, 8:57 PM - Yash Sinha: Well considering my irregular diet of bread, meat and cheese I was already taking multivitamins to compensate, but it's good to know that I should look at vitamin C and vitamin D specifically
07/10/15, 8:59 PM - Eric Galas: Again as Angela mentioned talking to a professional will get you the best recommendation but those are what I know some Canadians take.
07/10/15, 9:00 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: D is associated with sun exposure and C with immune system (but I think it was disproven) it's the two I go for too. But I think it's 40% placebo. The real deal is sports
07/10/15, 9:03 PM - Angela Hernandez: I read an article not long ago saying that they are helpful for cases of sleep deprivation during the winter but, placebo effect or not, you can win lots and the lost is close to nothing of they don't work
07/10/15, 9:03 PM - Eric Galas: The positive effect of sports on health and happiness have been documented in hundreds of different studies. It is a hugely important factor and one of the easiest ways to positively boost many aspects of your life
07/10/15, 9:04 PM - Angela Hernandez: Definitely agree with Guille and Eric!
07/10/15, 9:10 PM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>

08/10/15, 10:40 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: @saleh I just thought of the fax. Last century technology. When I started my business we felt it was important to have a fax number, so we look serious. And it did work.

08/10/15, 7:59 PM - Gaurav McGill: The Canadians must be scandalized at the thought of turning Montreal into Dubai
08/10/15, 8:00 PM - Deepti Kaul: Oh sorry Saleh I thought you meant Monday in general.. This upcoming Monday pretty much everything will be closed. Only 24h establishments would be open I think and even some smaller branches may be closed ex: Tim Hortons..

08/10/15, 8:25 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I propose we split it in two sections
08/10/15, 8:29 PM - Daisy: Nooooo it defeats the purpose :p! The lobby fits us all :D

08/10/15, 9:58 PM - Sumeet Singh: So were mine
08/10/15, 9:59 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Plugging things into your ears and listening to them at high volumes is detrimental to one's health. Telus health are advocates of healthy living and so they designed their earphones in such a way to deter music listeners from using them. I think it's brilliant.
08/10/15, 10:01 PM - Caroline: I love your logic!
08/10/15, 10:02 PM - Caroline: @Ankit, does your Fitbit work?

08/10/15, 10:04 PM - Yash Sinha: You're a sorceress Rosie
08/10/15, 10:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I love Harry Potter btw

08/10/15, 10:48 PM - Andrew Mutrie: There are nine face off dots. At these dots the puck is contested for by center men after a stoppage in play. Write that down and put it up on your wall sumeet! Priorities mang.
08/10/15, 10:50 PM - Sumeet Singh: As soon as the MR exam gets over, I'm getting on that, man.. Hockey time 😎👍

08/10/15, 11:09 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: That would be amazing. It means that we would start partying at 4:30 am!
08/10/15, 11:10 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Guillaume, there is order to this chaos
08/10/15, 11:13 PM - Caroline: Why is there Concordia university

09/10/15, 11:45 AM - Angela Hernandez: Guys quick info about the exam, Ali suggested that we may need to calculate the covariance in the exam, I've asked prof. Croitoru and he said he realizes it could be time consuming but if he does it would be a small computation nothing big
09/10/15, 11:45 AM - Angela Hernandez: Those were exactly his words
09/10/15, 11:46 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Thanks Angela!
09/10/15, 11:47 AM - Katya: Thanks Angela
09/10/15, 11:47 AM - Gul Kurtar: Thank you angela
09/10/15, 11:49 AM - Scott Fulton: Likely to give us the correlation coefficient though I'd think
09/10/15, 11:49 AM - Scott Fulton: The formula was on the formula sheet he gave
09/10/15, 11:50 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Ya correlation coefficient along with the variances of the two stocks or what not
09/10/15, 11:50 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Shouldn't be too complicated
09/10/15, 11:55 AM - Vikram Hooda: How do you do that
09/10/15, 11:57 AM - Angela Hernandez: Check out your notes, we did an exercise like that in class
09/10/15, 12:22 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey, was just thinking about was we could do after the after-exam group hug.
09/10/15, 12:23 PM - Kristov: There's a giant pillow fight at place des arts tonight. 1400 people I think.
09/10/15, 12:24 PM - Gul Kurtar: Go home and get rest first?
09/10/15, 12:27 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: The afternoon can look something like: group hug in the mba longe, pre-supper beer at bar close to school ( thompson house, gert's or other), supper at nice restaurant, drinks nice place like furco or some place in the plateau. I know some want to go back home ( "and look human" -Daisy) and can join the group after. I just want to spend some time with all of you guys, bridge the section gap!
09/10/15, 12:29 PM - Gul Kurtar: How lovely of you.
09/10/15, 12:31 PM - Kristov: Still planning on hiking tomorrow Guillaume?

09/10/15, 12:46 PM - Kristov: There's a Facebook event for it
09/10/15, 12:47 PM - Kristov: It's at 9 I believe. Was considering duct taping like 20 pillows to myself and wading through the carnage like a fluffy juggernaut.
09/10/15, 12:47 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hahah

10/10/15, 12:28 PM - Saleh: guillaume would b the perfect person to advise u
10/10/15, 12:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Ok I just called because I was a bit worried about the parking being full, so they said that when there is a holiday and the day looks amazing, parking tends to fill up quickly. The guy recommended we got there early ( as early as 8:45am). Maybe if we swapped the brunch and the hiking that would make it work, what do you think?
10/10/15, 12:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: And yes caro, it's a perfect place to bring the kids.
10/10/15, 12:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Mont-St-Hilaire

https://goo.gl/maps/VtS9NMrk39m
10/10/15, 12:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Most of the mountain is actually owned by McGill
10/10/15, 12:43 PM - Parker Donaldson: Wasn't it originally owned by Hamilton Galt, who then bequeathed it to McGill death?
10/10/15, 12:45 PM - Parker Donaldson: Yea. Actually it was. Incidentally he also independently founded the Princes Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. One of the three serving regiments of the canadian army. So there you go. You're all welcome for the history lesson.
10/10/15, 12:46 PM - Parker Donaldson: Guillaume. Good idea on the flipping of the schedule. Hike a mountain early. Get to brunch, where we'll be deserving of a good sized meal.
10/10/15, 12:47 PM - Saleh: grt idea guillaume
10/10/15, 12:49 PM - Caroline: Thanks for the info. Will get back to you guys
10/10/15, 12:50 PM - Parker Donaldson: Seriously though. Anyone with an appreciation for bad ass adventurer types of days of yore, wikipedia Hamilton Gault. He may be one of the most interesting canadians to have ever existed.
10/10/15, 12:52 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Whoa. He is the most interesting man.
10/10/15, 12:53 PM - Parker Donaldson: He even met hitler. He's like a canadian indian jones

12/10/15, 1:46 AM - Angela Hernandez: Guys, quick question for the ones that know about Canadian banking, is there any number to identify a bank? My government is asking me to report the unique ID of the bank were I hold my money here for taxing purposes (because Colombian government is "awesome" and taxes twice for it) but I am not sure how to find that info, would the swift number work? 
Any help is highly appreciated!
12/10/15, 1:53 AM - Saleh: ur bank can giv u the above info
12/10/15, 1:57 AM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
12/10/15, 2:16 AM - Ali Akerman: It's on your checks
12/10/15, 2:16 AM - Ali Akerman: <Media omitted>
12/10/15, 2:21 AM - Ali Akerman: The swift number is a unique identifier for banks that use the swift system. It is an interbank communication system in which every bank usually (but not necessarily) has one code. Not sure if that'd work.
12/10/15, 2:22 AM - Ali Akerman: Also as an FYI, Canada does not use IBAN
12/10/15, 2:52 AM - Andrew Mutrie: ... @ali show off

21/10/15, 12:25 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Power laces on kicks would have been awesome.
21/10/15, 12:25 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Parallel universe thing. He screwed up everything with his time travel, he should have been more careful. That's why we don't have fax machines on our walls.
21/10/15, 12:25 PM - Ryan Shields: I'll tie your shoes for $10 +gratuity

21/10/15, 6:49 PM - Yash Sinha: And who's at 9 for MNFPC?
21/10/15, 8:02 PM - Parker Donaldson: And what is MNFPC?
21/10/15, 8:03 PM - Yash Sinha: McGill Not for Profit Consulting
21/10/15, 8:06 PM - Gaurav McGill: Good luck guys!
21/10/15, 8:27 PM - Kunal Tuli: @yash :👍🏻
21/10/15, 9:46 PM - Vikram Hooda: Are we expected to dress up for the fifteen min interviews
21/10/15, 9:46 PM - Vikram Hooda: ??
21/10/15, 9:47 PM - Christian Gagne: They recommended we take it as if it were an interview I believe Vikram so it's really up to you. Dress to match whatever position you would be interviewing for.
21/10/15, 10:25 PM - Sumeet Singh: Guys
21/10/15, 10:26 PM - Sumeet Singh: What's the latest by which we can pick our courses for the next semester?
21/10/15, 10:28 PM - Eric Galas: In undergrad it was like a week or two into class so you can audit if you really want to take the classes...I assume it's similar
21/10/15, 10:29 PM - Sumeet Singh: Ohh... that sounds really good
21/10/15, 10:29 PM - Sumeet Singh: It's just that some courses I'd picked for testing some time ago started showing up on my unofficial transcript, which made me freak out
21/10/15, 10:29 PM - Eric Galas: Like you will want to sign up for classes before then but they won't be set in stone right away
21/10/15, 10:31 PM - Yash Sinha: AFAIK you can register for up to 21 credits per semester, attend 2 classes and then choose whether you're taking the class or not and if they are for credit or not... So that's 2 weeks for most classes
21/10/15, 10:32 PM - Yash Sinha: For best answers, talk to Dina
21/10/15, 10:33 PM - Ankit Balyan: last friday
21/10/15, 10:33 PM - Sumeet Singh: Thanks, guys... That helps
21/10/15, 10:33 PM - Ankit Balyan: sorry.. wrong group
21/10/15, 10:36 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah but I would also be considerate of others in the program since signing up for 21 credits (which realistically you aren't going to keep) takes away opportunities for other students to sign up for class that they may know they want to take for sure. So if you are just place holding I think it would respectful of everyone to only have maybe one additional course at first. Just my opinion
21/10/15, 10:38 PM - Yash Sinha: #ethicalerik ?
21/10/15, 10:38 PM - Eric Galas: Haha nicely played
21/10/15, 10:40 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I agree with Erik
21/10/15, 10:41 PM - Ankit Balyan: Yeah... I would back that opinion as well
21/10/15, 10:41 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Because of you Yash I've been on the waitlisted for managerial negotiations for the past 2 years
21/10/15, 10:41 PM - Ankit Balyan: 👍
21/10/15, 10:41 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Waitlist*
21/10/15, 10:47 PM - Yash Sinha: Hey I just got lucky to get in despite the waitlist... And I may be invoking consistency bias here but I intend to take the course next winter
21/10/15, 10:48 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Oh youre in it?
21/10/15, 10:48 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I was attempting to make a joke...now it seems like I was really angry 😳
21/10/15, 10:49 PM - Yash Sinha: Yeah I actually am... And there are certain people who are moderately pissed I got in ahead of them 😑
21/10/15, 10:49 PM - Yash Sinha: 😅*
21/10/15, 10:50 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Well Yash is King afterall
21/10/15, 10:52 PM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>
22/10/15, 7:10 AM - Eric Galas: Good morning everyone!  Sujata reached out to me this morning to get our input ASAP. For the Econ assignment we have only covered content in class up to question 3 and she would like to know whether we would prefer pushing back the assignment or for her to see if she can switch a class with another prof so she can get through the material. Let me know your opinions,  thanks!
22/10/15, 7:11 AM - Eric Galas: My opinion is keeping same time line with her switching for a new class by hopefully Monday so that we don't get assignments/Integrated case overlapping.
22/10/15, 7:13 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I agree. Pushing back the assignment is the less ideal solution. If she can switch a class it's great!
22/10/15, 7:13 AM - Samira Khajehi: I'd prefer that option as well
22/10/15, 7:14 AM - Daisy: Same here
22/10/15, 7:15 AM - Catherine Dupont: If her class is next Monday, then maybe she could give us til the end of the week to complete and hand it in (instead of Wednesday)
22/10/15, 7:16 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Best of both worlds in Catherine's proposal
22/10/15, 7:30 AM - Sara Mahabadi: I agree with next Monday and also maybe giving us more time for the assignment
22/10/15, 7:35 AM - Yatin: Yep, same here..
22/10/15, 7:36 AM - Yatin: Also Vikram, here's the answer to your question about back end and front end processes in class from yesterday...
22/10/15, 7:36 AM - Yatin: <Media omitted>
22/10/15, 7:39 AM - Deepti Kaul: Switching the class to Monday would be ideal
22/10/15, 7:50 AM - Nathalie: I'd prefer that as well!
22/10/15, 7:51 AM - Katya: I agree with next Monday
22/10/15, 8:04 AM - ‪+1 (514) 726-4344‬: Agree
22/10/15, 8:45 AM - Christian Gagne: Agree and slight extension would be nice as well
22/10/15, 10:18 AM - Eric Galas: Seems like most people would prefer the extra session ASAP and have the submission deadline slightly extended to cover the delay... any other feedback from others... section 2 want to be sure you are also on board and have had the chance to contribute
22/10/15, 10:36 AM - Alex K: As long as it's not marketing that gets pushed... Want to make sure to keep the spirits high!
22/10/15, 10:37 AM - Alex K: Just kidding - that sounds like the best option 👌🏼
22/10/15, 10:40 AM - Karen Sidhu: Yah that sounds great Erik! Thank you!
22/10/15, 10:40 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: thx #ETHICALERIK!

22/10/15, 11:07 AM - Eric Galas: Well played. .. thanks for the input everyone, I will follow up with Sujata and see if we can get that done
22/10/15, 11:39 AM - Andrew Mutrie: Joking aside thanks Erik
22/10/15, 1:16 PM - Eric Galas: Econ assignment update for section 1 since 2 jsut heard it.. Sujata understands our concerns regarding the assignments blending into each other so she said she will try to a find time when she can teach us the remaining material so for now start with questions 1-3  for the assignment and she will update me later. Sujata mentioned it may end up being a tutorial and we will cover the two additional questions at that time. Any questions or concerns please let me know.
22/10/15, 2:02 PM - Caroline: Related note, did she mention what would happen to the 2/3 exercises that we did not cover in the tutorial yesterday evening?
22/10/15, 2:04 PM - Eric Galas: No she didn't, my guess is during the next tutorial or additional work
22/10/15, 2:21 PM - Daisy: She actually mentioned that at the end of the tutorial yesterday
22/10/15, 2:21 PM - Daisy: That we will pick up from where we stopped in the next tutorial session

29/10/15, 8:16 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: <Media omitted>
29/10/15, 8:16 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: So, before coming to Canada I had the misconception that police would look like that. 

Where are these policeman if not in the streets?
29/10/15, 8:16 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: And Dibs on the costume!
29/10/15, 8:17 PM - Katya: 😄👍🏻 super costume. Btw my understanding of Canadian police is (was?) the same as well... Three month of hoping to meet one of those guys riding the horse)
29/10/15, 8:18 PM - Christian Gagne: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, RCMP for short, are a special division of law enforcement in Canada. They are a Federal police force.
29/10/15, 8:18 PM - Sara Mahabadi: And where are they Christian?
29/10/15, 8:19 PM - Alex K: At the Olympic stadium
29/10/15, 8:20 PM - Christian Gagne: So they're all over / they provide provincial policing as well but not in Quebec if I'm not mistaken
29/10/15, 8:21 PM - Eric Galas: They are all over canada in certain provinces they have a larger representation because there is no provincial police (quebec has a provincial police force so they are for specific roles in quebec) the red costume is formal dress for them so very rare unless are special events or in specific locations
29/10/15, 8:21 PM - Christian Gagne: Are they still headquartered in Ottawa?
29/10/15, 8:21 PM - Christian Gagne: Off the Vanier Parkway?
29/10/15, 8:23 PM - Eric Galas: They have provincial headquarters specifically divisions divided across Canada. Ottawa is the national headquarters (they have several attachments in Ottawa) and the one off the vanier parkway is also where they keep/train many of the showhorses
29/10/15, 8:24 PM - Christian Gagne: That I knew :) the stables are awesome
29/10/15, 8:24 PM - Alex K: They are the fbi equivalent are they not? So probably a lot of desk jobs
29/10/15, 8:24 PM - Christian Gagne: Basically
29/10/15, 8:25 PM - Christian Gagne: With CSIS being the CIA equivalent I guess
29/10/15, 8:25 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Thanks Erik and Christian
29/10/15, 8:26 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah exactly but they would also be considered our DEA and ATF since those roles all fall under RCMP. .. I used to work closely with the RCMP drug team
29/10/15, 8:27 PM - Alex K: Oh ok, so they are more encompassing.
29/10/15, 8:29 PM - Eric Galas: Yeah we have less organizations supposedly to reduce red tape but not the case in my experience
29/10/15, 8:33 PM - Angela Hernandez: <Media omitted>

29/10/15, 9:54 PM - Andrew Mutrie: I feel that writing a resume is like playing broken telephone w yourself. Every time you edit it, you fine tune the minutiae of your experience to sound ever more awesomely applicable, but further stretched further away from the plain truth!
29/10/15, 9:55 PM - Sumeet Singh: 😂😂
29/10/15, 9:55 PM - Sumeet Singh: on point

31/10/15, 4:13 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Apparently grades are up!
31/10/15, 4:19 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Speaking of the assignment. Is it me or Saibal Ray made a mistake in the 'new' question for assignment 4? He is missing a word or something no?
31/10/15, 4:20 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: If Target's objective is to achieve an expected fill rate of 98% (rather than maximize profit), Target’s order quantity, expected leftovers and expected lost sales (no need to calculate – just tell whether increase or decrease)?
31/10/15, 4:38 PM - Vikram Hooda: Grades for what ??

01/11/15, 7:01 PM - Vikram Hooda: Where is the link

01/11/15, 7:06 PM - Yash Sinha: Not to cause panic, but your performance may be directly linked to class participation grade 😊
01/11/15, 7:07 PM - Caroline: I hope not....😰
01/11/15, 7:07 PM - Daisy: Hahahaha Yash u really have to learn to say the right things at the right times
01/11/15, 7:08 PM - Vikram Hooda: How do I start the game
01/11/15, 7:08 PM - Yash Sinha: Yeah I know, the panic would've been much more effective if I'd informed people just before the simulation started 😈

03/11/15, 3:20 PM - Yash Sinha: Dear fellow MBA students -
A bunch of us are running a marketing study on beer and would like to invite 5 volunteers for a focus group today. We will meet at 4:50 pm in the MBA common area after which you will be accompanied to a secret location where we shall give you free beer samples and ask you a bunch of easy questions. Your valuable input shall help us make more informed decisions about beer and potentially optimize spending at Peel Pub and Thomson House. We will also share with volunteers any beer left over. You may leave any time after completing your part of the survey, and the last person shall leave the secret location by 6:15 pm. Do let us know here or individually if you want to be a part of this group that can change the face of beer consumption globally.
03/11/15, 3:50 PM - Yash Sinha: 3 spots to go guys, don't miss out this once in a lifetime opportunity 😊
03/11/15, 3:51 PM - Adnan Waheed: Sounds dodgy mate
03/11/15, 3:51 PM - Yash Sinha: We're giving you beer in exchange for an hour of your time. The only thing dodgy is the failure to see how awesome a value proposition this is.
03/11/15, 3:52 PM - Adnan Waheed: I would join if I were into beer :)
03/11/15, 3:52 PM - LG Krishna Canada: We
03/11/15, 3:53 PM - LG Krishna Canada: *We'll also be serving steak
03/11/15, 3:53 PM - Adnan Waheed: 😄😋
03/11/15, 3:56 PM - Yash Sinha: This just in, we'll also have limited catering from a Michelin starred chef - the wiifm value of your time just doubled
03/11/15, 4:05 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Anyone going to the database workshop?
03/11/15, 4:06 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It just disappeared from my calendar. Was it cancelled?
03/11/15, 4:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: It's moved
03/11/15, 4:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: To December 2nd
03/11/15, 4:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: A month
03/11/15, 4:08 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Are you bloody serious? No email no notification?
03/11/15, 4:33 PM - Adnan Waheed: Just had an email from Sarah.
03/11/15, 4:34 PM - Adnan Waheed: Very last minute, so I can understand the frustration.
03/11/15, 4:35 PM - Gul Kurtar: She sent the mail at 15:32
03/11/15, 4:35 PM - Adnan Waheed: Yes, that's pretty last minute, Gul.
03/11/15, 4:35 PM - Adnan Waheed: Not literally, but sort of.
03/11/15, 4:36 PM - Adnan Waheed: The workshop was supposed to start at 4:15.
03/11/15, 4:36 PM - Gul Kurtar: I was replying to the old boy adnan
03/11/15, 4:36 PM - Adnan Waheed: Haha
03/11/15, 4:36 PM - Adnan Waheed: Very well.
03/11/15, 4:43 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: For some reason I did not received the email.
03/11/15, 4:45 PM - Vikram Hooda: Guys the second question on the OM assignment .... is it based on process analysis 1 or 2??
03/11/15, 4:48 PM - Eric Galas: I also didn't receive email
03/11/15, 4:48 PM - Katya: I didn't get any email as well
03/11/15, 4:55 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: If there was an email it's ok, I was just a bit pissed because I noticed really at the last minute: I checked my schedule to know how much parking I should pay for, and that is when I noticed the event disappeared.
03/11/15, 4:57 PM - Parker Donaldson: Request reimbursement from the MBA.
03/11/15, 4:57 PM - Parker Donaldson: I heard that you could be reimbursed through subsidized beer in the basement.
03/11/15, 4:57 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
03/11/15, 5:21 PM - Rita Komarova: Hi everyone, for those that don't have FB or don't check those posts often, here is an information document that I just shared on FB. It's about Toronto (restaurants, bars, coffee shops for meetings and general info on the city). Composed by Andrew, Adam, Bryan, Christian, Angie and myself.

04/11/15, 4:14 PM - Sumeet Singh: We in India are still fighting over who gets to eat beef
04/11/15, 4:14 PM - Adnan Waheed: Those who don't are missing out.
04/11/15, 4:14 PM - Adnan Waheed: Jk
04/11/15, 4:14 PM - Yash Sinha: Some people in India who have nothing better to do are fighting over who gets to eat beef
04/11/15, 4:14 PM - Sumeet Singh: Say that in India and you start a riot
04/11/15, 4:21 PM - Ryan Shields: Canada is a sick country
04/11/15, 4:27 PM - Sumeet Singh: ☺
04/11/15, 4:28 PM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>
04/11/15, 4:32 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Yash - No beef for you!
04/11/15, 4:58 PM - Gaurav McGill: Canada has done well and is showing the world a lot of new ways, including on gender equality and not being afraid of fiscal deficits to drive growth
04/11/15, 5:01 PM - Yash Sinha: Well we learned how to distribute power between the center and the states from Canada way back in 1950, maybe it's time to learn some more
04/11/15, 5:01 PM - Gaurav McGill: But let's not belittle where we came from- India is a great country in its own particular ways. It needs to be better in a lot of ways and I hope we are able to contribute to doing so
04/11/15, 5:02 PM - Adnan Waheed: I thought this group was for banter.
04/11/15, 5:02 PM - Yash Sinha: So Adnan what steak are you cooking today?
04/11/15, 5:03 PM - Adnan Waheed: Don't have time for that today unfortunately. 😞
04/11/15, 5:03 PM - Gaurav McGill: Ha ha- Yes Adnan, let's move to your stake
04/11/15, 5:03 PM - Adnan Waheed: Next time I think I'll experiment a little and cook chicken steak instead.
04/11/15, 5:04 PM - Yash Sinha: Is a chicken steak really a chicken steak or is it just chicken breast masquerading as steak?
04/11/15, 5:04 PM - Gaurav McGill: Steak*
04/11/15, 5:04 PM - Adnan Waheed: The latter. But ssshhhh..
04/11/15, 5:04 PM - Yash Sinha: Well there's also the country fried steak variant
04/11/15, 5:05 PM - Adnan Waheed: Perhaps we can cook that together?
04/11/15, 5:06 PM - Adnan Waheed: Or a medium rare burger topped with bacon?
04/11/15, 5:07 PM - Yash Sinha: I am useless at cooking, though Krishna might be more willing to experiment cooking a country fried steak
04/11/15, 5:13 PM - Adnan Waheed: If Krishna is not too busy dissing North Indian food then yeah.
04/11/15, 5:15 PM - LG Krishna Canada: South Indian food> Steak>North Indian food
04/11/15, 5:15 PM - Yash Sinha: Krishna suffers from cognitive dissonance when it comes to South Indian food
04/11/15, 5:16 PM - Yash Sinha: Also everyone knows bacon >> everything
04/11/15, 5:16 PM - Adnan Waheed: Mmmm bacon
04/11/15, 6:07 PM - Akshay Kohli Canada: Waiting in Bronfman room 011, basement, for people interested in Hult prize. We have with us Julie Savaria, a social consultant, who will answer all your questions about social entrepreneurship

04/11/15, 7:29 PM - Adithya Bala: It only opened 5 min before the meeting started...i had joined 15 min before the join buttton was deactivated with a 10 min counter
04/11/15, 10:07 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yes lipdub, november 20th! Can't wait!

05/11/15, 8:53 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yeah, I found that naked picture request a bit weird.
05/11/15, 8:55 AM - Catherine Dupont: <Media omitted>
05/11/15, 9:12 AM - Deepti Kaul: Nope. Did you get it by email?
05/11/15, 9:14 AM - Ryan Shields: Maybe Angela doesn't have a picture in the thing McGill sent because she joined us later in base camp?
05/11/15, 9:15 AM - Deepti Kaul: Is that the case Angela?
05/11/15, 9:24 AM - LG Krishna Canada: I got the photo request as well...
05/11/15, 9:42 AM - Vikram Hooda: What td breakfast

05/11/15, 9:43 AM - Scott Fulton: Haha
05/11/15, 9:44 AM - Scott Fulton: It's not today vikram, it's part of the Toronto trip I think
05/11/15, 9:44 AM - Angela Hernandez: So I sent her an email and she said she has pics of everyone except from Krishna, the due that I have no idea and I.
05/11/15, 9:45 AM - Angela Hernandez: Dude*
05/11/15, 9:45 AM - Angela Hernandez: So my guess is that Ryan is right and is a delayed effect of getting here 3 weeks late
05/11/15, 11:19 AM - Adnan Waheed: Beautiful 12 degrees and the sun is out.
05/11/15, 11:21 AM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>

05/11/15, 11:23 AM - Adnan Waheed: Glad someone else shares the same thought. I've come to realise the value of the sun.
05/11/15, 11:57 AM - Eric Galas: Fyi all; it's not 100% confirmed and Sujata will follow-up to finalize but she would like everyone to block off November 20th (same day as Lipdub) between  4 and 530pm for the professors to present each concentration to us.
05/11/15, 11:57 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Lipdub with the profs? Great idea!
05/11/15, 12:00 PM - Eric Galas: I'm sure we could get a few to join if that's in the plan. .. I am sure the lipdub committee is all over it

08/11/15, 9:51 AM - Daisy: Calendar says 1 to 4
08/11/15, 9:52 AM - Saleh: i doubt there is any reveiw. what is the review for ?
08/11/15, 9:53 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I got a reminder saying there's a review tmrw 😬
08/11/15, 9:53 AM - Andrew Mutrie: Saleh we have an exam this coming week on Wednesday morning. It's for the most recent class called "value creation" covering Econ marketing operations and I s
08/11/15, 9:54 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Lmao
08/11/15, 9:56 AM - Saleh: didnt we already do the tutrials nd stuff ? wt thy gonna revew for us ?
08/11/15, 9:56 AM - Saleh: lool andrew
08/11/15, 10:13 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: It's true..marketing he sent us a video, om was Friday,  econ was Thursday
08/11/15, 10:13 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Is meh
08/11/15, 10:16 AM - Yash Sinha: Well it is optional... If you think you need to review something, you can attend, if you don't - oh boy are you in for a surprise when you get the exam
08/11/15, 10:17 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Lol so there is a review?
08/11/15, 10:18 AM - Saleh: i m not sure wt thy will do tht thy havnt done so far. in 3 hours. 4 proffessor. lool wt can thy possibly make u underestand. tht thy couldnt do in a month yash ? lool.

08/11/15, 10:20 AM - Yash Sinha: Maybe they will
08/11/15, 10:20 AM - Yash Sinha: It's optional, hence for those who want specific doubts cleared
08/11/15, 10:20 AM - Christian Gagne: Yash with the fear tactics lol
08/11/15, 10:27 AM - Parker Donaldson: By offering so many tutorials i feel they're ramping up fear tactics and expectations. All that's missing is Derek Hart sentimentally expressing his concerns of our failure. And then quoting sir francis galton.
08/11/15, 10:30 AM - Saleh: loool parker
08/11/15, 10:30 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Speaking of google calendars. We have a lunchover on Tuesday, haven't we?
08/11/15, 10:30 AM - Saleh: 😆😆
08/11/15, 10:32 AM - Parker Donaldson: Serious?! What? Nahhh. That is terribly inconvenient seeing as there is no class. Email stating mandatory and highly recommended sessions state nothing.
08/11/15, 10:33 AM - Yash Sinha: You'll get the email on Monday
08/11/15, 10:34 AM - Yash Sinha: And it's next Tuesday, not this one
08/11/15, 10:36 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Damn, I see it on my calendar both this Tuesday and next! You are right she did not mention it on the email!
08/11/15, 1:35 PM - Vikram Hooda: Does anyone know the answer to in class activity 9 part c
08/11/15, 1:52 PM - Vikram Hooda: Huh ???

08/11/15, 3:47 PM - Caroline: @nirros, when was the reminder for tomorrow's review sent?
08/11/15, 3:47 PM - Caroline: I don't see it in my mailbox
08/11/15, 3:48 PM - Yash Sinha: It was sent only to those students who need the review 😏
08/11/15, 3:51 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: @caroline what i meant was a reminder from my personal  calendar we got from the mba office at the start of the semester.
08/11/15, 3:51 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: @yash thanks for the vote of confidence 😒
08/11/15, 3:54 PM - Caroline: Oh! Thanks for clarifying 😂
I was typing to Yash saying that they did a bad evaluation of who needs reviews since I didn't get it. 👍
08/11/15, 4:06 PM - Gul Kurtar: Yea I don't have the mail either
08/11/15, 4:47 PM - Akshay Kohli Canada: Guys! In my opinion, The review is also for the integrative case, not just a general review
08/11/15, 4:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Case is due at 4pm and the review ends at the same time.
08/11/15, 5:03 PM - Akshay Kohli Canada: Oh, i thought the review is at 4
08/11/15, 9:30 PM - Kristov: Props to Erik for being the #1 fan at our hockey game!

08/11/15, 9:40 PM - Karen Sidhu: Did you guys win?!
08/11/15, 9:55 PM - Scott Fulton: So competitive Karen! Is that all you care about?? We had fun how about that! Hahaha
08/11/15, 9:59 PM - Karen Sidhu: So I'll take that as a no? Just kidding haha glad you had fun 😏

08/11/15, 10:04 PM - Christian Gagne: Blame it on the refs?
08/11/15, 10:04 PM - Scott Fulton: Haha I wouldn't dare
09/11/15, 6:53 AM - Catherine Dupont: Hi all, 
I asked Sujata if we had a review session today as mentioned in the syllabus. This is her answer:
"Hi Catherine –
No review – as I have had the tutorial and we have all posted our review notes on myCourses.
Some of us will be available for office hours at that time.
-Sujata"
Hope this clarifies.
09/11/15, 6:56 AM - Sumeet Singh: 😱😱
09/11/15, 6:56 AM - Sumeet Singh: What is it that we have today, then?
09/11/15, 7:00 AM - Catherine Dupont: She says there is no review but the profs will have office hours at that time if you want to go see them with questions.
09/11/15, 7:01 AM - Sumeet Singh: Oh.. So no formal "session"... Got it
09/11/15, 7:01 AM - Sumeet Singh: Thanks

09/11/15, 10:01 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: The thing is
09/11/15, 10:02 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: The only thing about the leafs that change from year to year are the players
09/11/15, 10:02 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: What I like about them is their consistency. They are consistently shitty from year to year. 😁
09/11/15, 10:05 AM - Catherine Dupont: Nirros, be nice. The leafs are like the Titanic... they look good until they hit the ice
09/11/15, 10:05 AM - Christian Gagne: 🔥🔥🔥🔥
09/11/15, 10:06 AM - Adam Cappabianca: Haha Can't argue with that Nirros. All I'm saying is that habs also suck! If you don't win it all, then you accomplish the same thing as the last place team

09/11/15, 3:03 PM - Yash Sinha: They are compensating for reduced study time by putting us close to each other to facilitate cooperative exam taking
09/11/15, 3:03 PM - Yash Sinha: Or the paper is going to be so off the charts difficult that they know it doesn't matter how close we sit to each other
09/11/15, 3:04 PM - Chiren Shah: Its a bell curve.....payoffs r asymetric Yash 😉

10/11/15, 9:29 AM - Ryan Shields: Was it confirmed that there is no lunchover today?
10/11/15, 9:29 AM - Christian Gagne: I think Mona's e-mail indirectly confirmed that no?
10/11/15, 9:29 AM - Mimi Orr: That's my guess as well
10/11/15, 9:30 AM - Ryan Shields: I think that's fair
10/11/15, 10:09 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: We could let them believe we are all waiting in the mba lounge by sending them an old picture. That would teach them to be more careful with the google calendar!
10/11/15, 10:46 AM - Yatin: On this Diwali eve, may Goddess Lakshmi provide you with 7 forms of wealth: Money, Health, Food, Children, Knowledge, Courage and Victory.
10/11/15, 10:46 AM - Yatin: Happy Diwali to all!
10/11/15, 10:50 AM - Gaurav McGill: Isn't Diwali tomorrow?
10/11/15, 10:51 AM - Yatin: Today is the chhoti Diwali...
10/11/15, 10:51 AM - Gaurav McGill: Oh yes😊!
10/11/15, 11:18 AM - Adnan Waheed: I'll take all of them, except the children. Thanks, Yatin.
10/11/15, 12:26 PM - Angela Hernandez: Hahaha Adnan!
10/11/15, 12:29 PM - Caroline: Is deepavali different from dawali?
10/11/15, 12:29 PM - Yash Sinha: Christmas Xmas
10/11/15, 12:31 PM - Caroline: 😂
10/11/15, 12:31 PM - Yash Sinha: Diwali just rolls off the tongue easier
10/11/15, 12:34 PM - Yash Sinha: @Gaurav,Yatin ... In Bengal we celebrate Diwali one day earlier on Kali Puja, so today is Diwali for me 😁
10/11/15, 12:36 PM - Gaurav McGill: Ahh okay- no wonder am getting a lot of diwali messages today
10/11/15, 1:21 PM - LG Krishna Canada: @Caroline - The southern part of India calls it Deepavali.
10/11/15, 1:35 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Guys, anybody has a spare calculator, that I can borrow for tomorrow's exam?
10/11/15, 1:38 PM - Yash Sinha: @Sumit... Ask the MBA office
10/11/15, 1:39 PM - Caroline: @krishna n Yash: thanks! No more confusion 😎
10/11/15, 1:40 PM - Bhanu Chandra Canada: @sumit. I have one if u want
10/11/15, 1:41 PM - Yash Sinha: I'm fairly certain it's not just southern that calls it deepawali, it's a pretty pan Indian term
10/11/15, 1:42 PM - Ankit Balyan: This is a case of an incorrect inference due to a small sample size 😁
10/11/15, 1:43 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Sumit how'd you score that 840 on the gnat without an internal scientific calculator? Man up
10/11/15, 1:44 PM - Yash Sinha: Yeah Sumit, you're from IIT, to get in you have to know every single mathematical computation by heart, you shouldn't need the calculator
10/11/15, 1:44 PM - Adnan Waheed: Somebody invite Ryan to that herbivore Christmas party.
10/11/15, 1:45 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Lol..
10/11/15, 1:45 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Bhanu .. Is it a casio?
10/11/15, 1:46 PM - Ryan Shields: Did someone say vegetables?
10/11/15, 1:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: Yep
10/11/15, 1:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: Natasha knows all about that party.
10/11/15, 1:47 PM - Adnan Waheed: It's a secret society's party.
10/11/15, 1:47 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Exam at 8-1130am tomorrow morning room 360 and 340. Clarified by Dina for me. Cheers
10/11/15, 1:47 PM - Bhanu Chandra Canada: @Sumit its a Sharp fin calculator
10/11/15, 1:47 PM - Ryan Shields: Thx for clarifying Andrew. Interesting info adnan
10/11/15, 1:48 PM - Adnan Waheed: You see, I'm looking out for you bruv
10/11/15, 1:48 PM - Sumit Kalawat: @andrew- That early in the morning, even an OM calculator won't be able to help me
10/11/15, 1:48 PM - Yash Sinha: Adnan is the real guv'n
10/11/15, 1:48 PM - Sumit Kalawat: If there is such a thing as OM calculator😀
10/11/15, 1:49 PM - Sumit Kalawat: I thought they banned shark fin soup !
10/11/15, 1:50 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Never mind! I will get in touch with MBA office and if they have a casio, I'll take it, or else I can borrow from you. Thanks👍
10/11/15, 1:50 PM - Bhanu Chandra Canada: 👍
10/11/15, 1:50 PM - Sumit Kalawat: I'm sort of used to the casio's, not very comfortable with financial calculators

10/11/15, 1:59 PM - Ryan Shields: Eating beef is all fun and games until the cows start fighting back...
10/11/15, 2:00 PM - Adnan Waheed: Stop killing the plants, Ryan
10/11/15, 2:01 PM - Adnan Waheed: I do love me some potatoes tho
10/11/15, 2:01 PM - Adnan Waheed: But Caroline says they're not vegetables
10/11/15, 2:02 PM - Ryan Shields: You could always have a side of brocolli for that added protein brotato
10/11/15, 2:10 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Wait. How many broccolis do you have to eat to have 100 calories? vs beef?
10/11/15, 2:13 PM - Adnan Waheed: 11.1 grams, Guillaume!
10/11/15, 2:14 PM - Ryan Shields: Adnan apparently those numbers are messed up from reality
10/11/15, 2:14 PM - Ryan Shields: Which isn't really surprising
10/11/15, 2:14 PM - Adnan Waheed: That's why it's "propaganda"
10/11/15, 2:15 PM - Ryan Shields: So you're spreading propaganda. Are you a closet vegetarian? Are all those pictures of steak a lie?
10/11/15, 2:15 PM - Adnan Waheed: Nooo, it's not me
10/11/15, 2:16 PM - Adnan Waheed: http://fuckyeahsteaks.tumblr.com/
This is the tumblr I follow every day
10/11/15, 2:37 PM - Parker Donaldson: Does anyone have the solutions for assignment 1 numbers 4 and 5? The 'slow sujata' and 'silly sujata' solutions.
10/11/15, 2:38 PM - Adnan Waheed: Not official ones, but I worked on them last night.
10/11/15, 2:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 2:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: You can try those. But the hand writing is not amazing.
10/11/15, 2:43 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 2:43 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: First mover advantage.
10/11/15, 2:45 PM - Parker Donaldson: You made thT question 4 more complicated than it needed to be i feel.
10/11/15, 2:46 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: As for the broccoli, the ad is tru but misleading : there are 6.4 grams of protein in 100 calories of meat. Which is about 50 grama. And 11.1 grams of protein in 100 calories of broccoli.. That is about 3 bunches (1.8 kg)
10/11/15, 2:47 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Comparing 50 g of meat vs 1800g of broccoli
10/11/15, 2:47 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: How did you solve question 4 Parker?
10/11/15, 2:49 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I did on a per costumer basis, if you multiply by 3 you should get the total revenue. That may be the difference
10/11/15, 2:49 PM - Adnan Waheed: Gahddayum, Guillaume. Y'er on top o' your shiz.
10/11/15, 2:50 PM - Parker Donaldson: Yea. That is what i did differently. None of this 8166$ per customer.
10/11/15, 2:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Type how many calories in broccoli and you get a really nice calculator by google
10/11/15, 2:50 PM - Adnan Waheed: Hahah
10/11/15, 3:15 PM - Alex K: Are you sure there's 2 Nash. I only get one. New g and combo
10/11/15, 3:22 PM - Adnan Waheed: I only got one, with no dominant strategy.
10/11/15, 3:22 PM - Alex K: Weakly dominant
10/11/15, 3:22 PM - Alex K: For trickster
10/11/15, 3:22 PM - Alex K: No strategy for PP
10/11/15, 3:30 PM - Alex K: For question b
10/11/15, 3:48 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I am pretty sure there are two nash equilibria. And i am very confident there are no dominant strategy
10/11/15, 3:49 PM - Kristov: Janon's email says the entire Toronto trip requires business attire, but also says to only bring a carry on sized piece of luggage
10/11/15, 3:49 PM - Kristov: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 3:49 PM - Kristov: Crumpled suit squad
10/11/15, 3:50 PM - Scott Fulton: A form of peacocking?
10/11/15, 3:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Actually there is only one equilibrium
10/11/15, 3:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: There is plenty of room in the train..
10/11/15, 3:50 PM - Scott Fulton: Yeah I don't have a proper suit travel bag
10/11/15, 3:53 PM - Kristov: I have an extra one if you'd like
10/11/15, 3:55 PM - Kristov: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 3:55 PM - Kristov: That sort of thing.
10/11/15, 3:56 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: @alex, there is no such thing as 'weakly' dominant. Sujata would expel. A dominant strategy means that you would go for a strategy irrespective of what the other does. (that your gain is consistently the highest for that option).  I spoke to her yesterday because it wasn't clear to me.
10/11/15, 3:57 PM - Parker Donaldson: Alternative scott. For a fee, i will wear your suit during the train trip. I'll remain standing the entire time to ensure minimal creases. My rate for this service is $30 an hour.
10/11/15, 3:57 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: Outsource it.. I'll do it for 10
10/11/15, 4:00 PM - Kristov: FYI it's supposed to rain all week in Toronto
10/11/15, 4:00 PM - Kristov: Vivek I'll pay you 10$ an hour to follow me around with an umbrella and be my valet
10/11/15, 4:01 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: If I'll have to walk.. It'll be 20
10/11/15, 4:02 PM - LG Krishna Canada: I'll do it for a fixed fee of 25 per day and 5 for every hour.
10/11/15, 4:02 PM - Ryan Shields: You could use a segway
10/11/15, 4:02 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: @ alex. Sorry, Actually there is such think a weakly dominance. But I am not sure it applies here
10/11/15, 4:03 PM - Kristov: That's a pretty competitive bid Krishna.
10/11/15, 4:04 PM - Kristov: A valet has to be witty and crack well timed jokes. And throw shade at ppl who step to me.
10/11/15, 4:04 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I am not sure how well McGill reputation would be served, having one part of the class being the valet of the other..
10/11/15, 4:05 PM - Christian Gagne: Even if undergrads are recruited?
10/11/15, 4:05 PM - Kristov: You think there's something wrong with being a valet
10/11/15, 4:06 PM - Kristov: Actually Christian you're on to something. All the undergrads should 'intern' as our executive assistants. To see how business is done in the real world.
10/11/15, 4:06 PM - Christian Gagne: That's the start of an enterprise right there
10/11/15, 4:09 PM - Deepti Kaul: Speaking of Toronto, who is going to the Janssen session?
10/11/15, 4:09 PM - Bryan Au: 👆🏼
10/11/15, 4:10 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Why are you pointing Bryan?
10/11/15, 4:11 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: +1
10/11/15, 4:11 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Normally people lift their hands when asked such a question: ✋
10/11/15, 4:11 PM - Adnan Waheed: Nirros, pls..
10/11/15, 4:11 PM - Deepti Kaul: Do you guys know if we're getting transported there somehow? their office is in North York :(
10/11/15, 4:12 PM - Angela Hernandez: Deepti I have just noticed we have the same schedule
10/11/15, 4:12 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Sorry Adnan...
10/11/15, 4:13 PM - Adnan Waheed: Haha
10/11/15, 4:13 PM - Deepti Kaul: lol
10/11/15, 4:13 PM - Bryan Au: I kinda assumed transportation included
10/11/15, 4:13 PM - Bryan Au: If not, I'll drive
10/11/15, 4:13 PM - Deepti Kaul: Oops I actually haven't looked at the Toronto emails yet so maybe it is included sorry
10/11/15, 4:14 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😅
10/11/15, 4:14 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: If not, Bryan will drive everyone
10/11/15, 4:14 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: He'll even make 2 trips if he has too, such a nice guy
10/11/15, 4:14 PM - Bryan Au: Hope everyone attended clown school
10/11/15, 4:15 PM - Deepti Kaul: But if it isn't, can I get a seat in your vehicle please Byran? 😇
10/11/15, 4:15 PM - Adnan Waheed: If you spell his name right he might be able to.
10/11/15, 4:16 PM - Bryan Au: Sure, deepti
10/11/15, 4:16 PM - Christian Gagne: Sassy Adnan
10/11/15, 4:16 PM - Adnan Waheed: Lol
10/11/15, 4:17 PM - Deepti Kaul: Jeez sorry, Bryan
10/11/15, 4:18 PM - Deepti Kaul: Thank you!!
10/11/15, 4:35 PM - Yash Sinha: As per Rachel's mail, Kunal Tuli is networking's middle name
10/11/15, 4:36 PM - Ankit Balyan: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 4:36 PM - Ankit Balyan: 😂
10/11/15, 4:36 PM - Kunal Tuli: 😉
10/11/15, 4:37 PM - Ankit Balyan: kind of like Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa 😂
10/11/15, 4:40 PM - Deepti Kaul: lol i noticed that
10/11/15, 4:48 PM - Chiren Shah: Kunal d rockstar 😆
10/11/15, 4:52 PM - Adnan Waheed: LADS!
10/11/15, 4:52 PM - Adnan Waheed: It's confirmed!
10/11/15, 4:52 PM - Adnan Waheed: There's no dominant strategy in question 5 - confirmed with Sujata
10/11/15, 4:56 PM - Yatin: +1 for Jansen
10/11/15, 5:04 PM - Deepti Kaul: Is there a weakly dominant strategy?
10/11/15, 5:04 PM - Alex K: No Adnan can help you out ;)
10/11/15, 5:10 PM - Saleh: bk to q5. there is a domin strategy for trick which is to choose combination. and i got two nash. new and comb.  com and tradi.
10/11/15, 5:12 PM - Saleh: trick is better off to choose combination no matter what pumpkin chooses
10/11/15, 5:13 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 5:15 PM - Alex K: There's only one Nash when it's simultaneous
10/11/15, 5:15 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: A weakly dominant would mean that one would have either a better outcome one one strategy and at least the same payoff as the opponent on the others.
10/11/15, 5:16 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's not the case. We have not seen that in class either, right?
10/11/15, 5:16 PM - Alex K: Weakly dominant does not apply here
10/11/15, 5:16 PM - Alex K: But we have seen it in class
10/11/15, 5:17 PM - Saleh: i dont underestand. there is clearly a domint strategy for trick. choose combination
10/11/15, 5:17 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I don't remeber that.. Maybe in section 2 haha
10/11/15, 5:17 PM - Saleh: i dont remeber weakly too.
10/11/15, 5:17 PM - Alex K: Saleh, not when pp does a combo
10/11/15, 5:18 PM - Saleh: opps alex my bad haha
10/11/15, 5:18 PM - Saleh: i cant read my own handwriting 😁
10/11/15, 5:19 PM - Saleh: and yes there is one equilibrium.
10/11/15, 5:20 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: When I spoke to Sujata she did not mention strictly dominant or weakly dominant.. I suspect 'weakly dominance' will not be part of the exam.
10/11/15, 5:20 PM - Adnan Waheed: Lol. Don't make such assumptions, Guillaume.
10/11/15, 5:21 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: She insisted more on the impact of dominance on the results
10/11/15, 5:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: And I don't recall her mentioning in class, and it's not in the notes..     And now we all know what it is so..
10/11/15, 5:27 PM - Ryan Shields: It was mentioned in tutorial 2 and she said it is fair game
10/11/15, 5:28 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I should have stayed instead of drinking beer I guess
10/11/15, 5:28 PM - Ryan Shields: Tutorial exercise 6 Holland is weakly dominant in going low
10/11/15, 5:30 PM - Adnan Waheed: Guillaume Charpenel has an absolute advantage in drinking beer.
10/11/15, 5:33 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I see. Just because it could go high but the payoff is the same as low in case Monsanto goes low.. So it's not strictly low
10/11/15, 5:33 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Thanks for the reference!
10/11/15, 5:33 PM - Adnan Waheed: Guys, don't study too much. Chill out and have a good time.
10/11/15, 5:33 PM - Ryan Shields: np
10/11/15, 5:34 PM - Ryan Shields: Guys, don't listen to adnan. He's just saying that so he can be on the right side of the bell curve
10/11/15, 5:35 PM - Adnan Waheed: Oh, Ryan..
10/11/15, 5:35 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Is he playing the prisoner game with us?
10/11/15, 5:35 PM - Yash Sinha: Adnan haven't you been tutoring people since Saturday as you were done studying?
10/11/15, 5:37 PM - Adnan Waheed: What are ya talking about, Yash
10/11/15, 5:37 PM - Yash Sinha: Just checking
10/11/15, 6:08 PM - Andrew Mutrie: I can't believe jui recommended a Ted talk from our very own Erik galas!
10/11/15, 6:25 PM - Eric Galas: ???
10/11/15, 6:25 PM - Adnan Waheed: He's saying that the guy in the Ted talk looks like you.
10/11/15, 6:26 PM - Yash Sinha: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 6:28 PM - Eric Galas: Got it. .. forgot what shirky looked like
10/11/15, 6:30 PM - Yash Sinha: Whaaaaa... I thought every day you see yourself in the mirror you wonder whether you're Erik Galas, Pete Russo or Clay Shirky
10/11/15, 6:31 PM - Eric Galas: Haha
10/11/15, 6:52 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 7:48 PM - Yatin: Do we know the room numbers or same as before?

10/11/15, 8:40 PM - Ankit Balyan: Wc guys
10/11/15, 8:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Wc?
10/11/15, 8:41 PM - Ankit Balyan: Welcome
10/11/15, 8:42 PM - Eric Galas: Or commonly used in Europe "water closet"
10/11/15, 8:43 PM - Ankit Balyan: No 😂
10/11/15, 9:04 PM - Gul Kurtar: I'm not sure but it might be a good idea for intl students to bring their passports/equivalents for hotel check-in purposes
10/11/15, 9:05 PM - Ankit Balyan: Yes.. I would think so too
10/11/15, 9:46 PM - Saleh: where is mcdonlads ? in email said meeting point mcdonlads
10/11/15, 9:53 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: If that's all they said...Goodluck my friend
10/11/15, 9:57 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: McDonalds at the Olympic Stadium
10/11/15, 9:57 PM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
10/11/15, 9:58 PM - Bryan Au: Probably the McD's in the train station
10/11/15, 9:58 PM - Eric Galas: There is a mcdonalds in the train station so that's what I am going with
10/11/15, 9:58 PM - Saleh: if thts the case why 1 hour earlier than departure lol
10/11/15, 9:59 PM - Sumit Kalawat: @saleh- to take care of standard deviation of 30 mins
10/11/15, 10:00 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Btw i had thought we were meeting at McDonald's on St. Catherine
10/11/15, 10:00 PM - Saleh: i am usually the lower boundry of tht 30 min
10/11/15, 10:00 PM - Ankit Balyan: I assumed it was the McDonald's at the train station
10/11/15, 10:01 PM - Sumit Kalawat: And im usually the 1.5% left after 2sigmas
10/11/15, 10:01 PM - Saleh: i didnt even know there is MCdonalds here in montreal hahah
10/11/15, 10:01 PM - Saleh: hahah sumit

10/11/15, 10:08 PM - Saleh: lol
10/11/15, 10:14 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: There is a mcdonald a the station. You just can't miss it.
10/11/15, 10:15 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Just go into any McDonalds, they will transport you to Toronto when you buy a Happy Meal
10/11/15, 10:16 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yup, I am going at the olympic stadium one.

You can get an extension if that is the case. Message me directly. Thank youuuu

30/11/15, 5:07 PM - Aiya: Our BT and MR grades now show up in the unofficial transcript section starting last week. The rest is just an innocent prank ;) Come on guys, we have not seen most of VC homework assessments ( homework 2 and group project ) I heard from MBA2 that last year some employers looked at the transcript with two courses graded, and that was enough

30/11/15, 6:54 PM - Parker Donaldson: Hey everyone. As you may be aware, i had the ridiculous idea to nominate myself for PGSS VP Internal. The campaigning has officially begun, and unfortunately it's too late for me to back out now. You will be receiving an email from PGSS detailing this tomorrow, but I like you all and decided to share the straight dope now 😘. There are 3 candidates total and there will be a DEBATE tomorrow night, 8 PM at the THOMSON house. I'm not sure what i'll say yet. But rest assured, there will probably be a plenty of inside jokes from the program. So you're attendance would be much appreciated. I can only laugh at my own jokes for so long before i am thought to be clinically insane.
30/11/15, 7:04 PM - Alex K: Go Parker! You got this buddy!

01/12/15, 11:13 AM - Yash Sinha: Although if you don't, then she won't discuss it in section 2 as well... Thus keeping both classes in sync and making it feasible to attend either class if you have a schedule conflict
01/12/15, 11:25 AM - Andrew Mutrie: Yash this type of k street rent seeking behavior will surely lead to a reduced cumulative output
01/12/15, 12:35 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I lost my brown scarf..

02/12/15, 10:39 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: What?

02/12/15, 10:41 PM - Yash Sinha: Well as of now when you search for Desautels or McGill MBA, Lipdub is what shows up on top
02/12/15, 10:41 PM - Parker Donaldson: Will there be an opportunity to 'ghost it' during the lip dub?

03/12/15, 11:42 AM - Natasha Sakina Alani: from the west coast peanut gallery... I know running for dgss is tough and draining especially at this time in the core.  i gotta say -- much respect for everyone who is stepping up, and putting in the effort. It's hard to put yourself out there, it's hard to run in a race with your friends and colleagues.  I would never have the kahones to do that. We love all of you for doing it, and doing it with style and humour. #everyoneisawinner
03/12/15, 11:58 AM - Katya: So well said @Natasha! I join your words of support of all the candidates. Guys, you brought the campaigning to the whole new level 👍🏻

07/12/15, 7:37 PM - Eric Galas: Haha well Guillaume I am still as sure as I was this morning haha. I officially asked Mona last week when there was confusion between the lunch over which was in people's calendar for last week and she said that Tuesday this week was scheduled.  I haven't followed up further so unless changes were made and no one mentioned it to me then there is a lunchover tomorroe
07/12/15, 7:41 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Great! We were discussing here and the only reliable source was you. I wanted to make sure I heard properly. You made a couple of happy stomachs here!
07/12/15, 7:43 PM - Scott Fulton: Yeah Natasha was making lunch for tomorrow!
07/12/15, 7:43 PM - Eric Galas: Haha well I hope that it ends up being true. In discussion with some other students today we were trying to speculate what the topic of the lunchover would be about and it was mentioned that maybe they will finally reveal the International trip destination to us so that got me excited but who knows at this point
07/12/15, 7:46 PM - Parker Donaldson: International trip info would be cool. Or maybe they'll provide the grades from the last module. The anticipation for the marks is almost as high. 😬
07/12/15, 7:53 PM - Angela Hernandez: They are graded already
07/12/15, 7:53 PM - Angela Hernandez: I think they are putting the curve

08/12/15, 12:02 PM - Samira Khajehi: Maybe you'll buy mascara though
08/12/15, 12:03 PM - Samira Khajehi: (don't kill me Yatin)
08/12/15, 12:27 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Muskara, it will straighten and highlight your eyelashes, and couples as an eau du toilette. It contains real bits of Panther... Smells like used diapers stuffed with the contents of the mini fridges.

08/12/15, 4:24 PM - Yash Sinha: Like if you want we can call you Adnan Steakwalla
08/12/15, 4:24 PM - Adnan Waheed: I like that.

28/12/15, 5:58 PM - Samira Khajehi: I think powder aka snow
28/12/15, 6:00 PM - LG Krishna Canada: In North America pow is short for powder or fresh snow. In South America however.... 😜
28/12/15, 6:01 PM - Sumit Kalawat: Lol.. Okay
28/12/15, 6:01 PM - Adnan Waheed: What's pow in South America, LG?
28/12/15, 6:02 PM - Sumit Kalawat: There's this fascinating new series called 'Narcos' on Netflix, Adnan I suggest you watch it
28/12/15, 6:05 PM - Eric Galas: It will give you some insight into pow in South America
28/12/15, 6:23 PM - Sara Mahabadi: <Media omitted>
28/12/15, 6:23 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Beautiful British Columbia
28/12/15, 7:45 PM - Angela Hernandez: In all respect I am completely against that tv show
28/12/15, 7:46 PM - Angela Hernandez: It reflects a very negative side of my country that is in no way what we want to share
28/12/15, 7:46 PM - Angela Hernandez: However I have heard great reviews
28/12/15, 7:59 PM - Adnan Waheed: It's good I'm not patriotic.
28/12/15, 8:28 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I agree with Angela, it always makes me sad when Latin America is associated with drugs, when most of it is consumed in the US anyways. They say it kills a kitten each time you do it.
28/12/15, 8:35 PM - Alex K: Coca leaves don't grow in the US, most of the production is in Latin America...don't be sad. And the show is a historical account of the late 80's and early 90's (when Escobar died).
28/12/15, 8:36 PM - Sumeet Singh: You're not supposed to feed it to the kitten, Guillaume.
28/12/15, 8:37 PM - Adnan Waheed: Spot on, Sumeet!
28/12/15, 8:38 PM - Angela Hernandez: Historical?
28/12/15, 8:39 PM - Angela Hernandez: Thanks Guillaume
28/12/15, 8:39 PM - Alex K: Is Escobar not part of history?
28/12/15, 8:39 PM - Alex K: Or the war on drugs?
28/12/15, 8:40 PM - Angela Hernandez: The guys existed and the drugs unfortunately are connected to the conflict my country has been fighting for half a century but is not a historic program
28/12/15, 8:40 PM - Angela Hernandez: Is a tv show
28/12/15, 8:40 PM - Angela Hernandez: So don't believe all you see there
28/12/15, 8:42 PM - Alex K: A tv show about historical events. Which parts of the show should we not believe? Would be interesting to hear from a Columbian.
28/12/15, 8:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: Where's Ali expert when we need him?
28/12/15, 8:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: Ali, mate, we miss ya!
28/12/15, 8:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: *Ali the expert
28/12/15, 9:00 PM - Angela Hernandez: A tv show is not a credible historical source but if you are interested I'd recommend you to read the books of Francisco E. Thoumi like "Ilegal drugs, Economy and Society in the Andes"
28/12/15, 9:03 PM - Alex K: Why is a TV show not credible, specifically Narcos? It's not a detailed historical account such a history book, but can give a glimpse of what was going on. If Narcos is garbage, I'd love to hear why from your perspective.
28/12/15, 9:04 PM - Angela Martinez McGill: @alex...it's Colombian not Columbian
28/12/15, 9:04 PM - Alex K: @angela m. My sincerest apologies for the misspelling.
28/12/15, 9:04 PM - Angela Hernandez: Is like saying that Rambo III is precise about Afghanistan during the soviet invasion
28/12/15, 9:06 PM - Alex K: Not really, Rambo is a fictional tale. Pablo Escobar was a real person.
28/12/15, 9:07 PM - Ali Akerman: Haha I'm not getting into this but all I'll say is that certain regions in Latin America would have been far more into poverty w/o the drug trade
28/12/15, 9:08 PM - Ali Akerman: Freakonomics has a couple of good examples on how it stemmed legal agriculture, especially in Peru
28/12/15, 9:08 PM - Alex K: I'm sure the Swiss banking sector didn't mind either
28/12/15, 9:09 PM - Ali Akerman: We never mind as long as they pay their fees. That's the benefit of being neutral
28/12/15, 9:09 PM - Angela Hernandez: The American agent from Narcos is a fictional character too, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from Rambo III is  a real historical event
28/12/15, 9:09 PM - Alex K: Haha👌🏼
28/12/15, 9:14 PM - Alex K: Actually the real DEA agent  was a consultant to the show and he is quite real.
28/12/15, 9:16 PM - Angela Hernandez: There was American involvement in the situation but there is no evidence that he played the role portrayed in the show
28/12/15, 9:16 PM - Alex K: We can have a talk about this some other time outside of the group. But I recommend you watch it and then would love to hear your input afterwards.
28/12/15, 9:16 PM - Adnan Waheed: I'm loving this.
28/12/15, 9:16 PM - Samira Khajehi: Lol relax Adnan
28/12/15, 9:17 PM - Leon Montiel: I'm not Colombian but I have read about what happened and I have watch some episodes. There are some elements that actually happened but a lot of it is exaggerated
28/12/15, 9:18 PM - Leon Montiel: It entertainment at the end of the day and that's what the creators were aiming for . Not necessarily an accurate recollection of events
28/12/15, 9:20 PM - Alex K: I never claimed its 100% accurate, but it does have the basic historical events embedded in the show. And the show can serve as a spring board for those that want to read more about it. Leon, thank you for your input.
28/12/15, 9:21 PM - Ali Akerman: On a related note, I think Game of Thrones is also vastly steered away from reality.
28/12/15, 9:21 PM - Samira Khajehi: Whaaaat I thought that was historical too!
28/12/15, 9:22 PM - LG Krishna Canada: My 2 cents - If you're paying more than $20 a gram, you're overpaying...
28/12/15, 9:22 PM - Leon Montiel: Ali just released to me that Santa Claus is not real😳
28/12/15, 9:22 PM - Leon Montiel: Revealed*
28/12/15, 9:22 PM - Eric Galas: Seriously I've been saving to buy one of those dragon eggs
28/12/15, 9:22 PM - Ali Akerman: No Santa is real Leon, don't mess with the Claus.
28/12/15, 9:23 PM - Leon Montiel: Hahaha. Phew
28/12/15, 11:05 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: One thing is not accurate at all....
Pablo Escobar did not have that thick Brazilian accent when speaking Spanish as portrayed in the show!

Further, the show is the view of a DEA agent, who tells a story that happened in Colombia, lived by Colombians (and not truly lived by an American agent). In that sense, as commonly understood, Hollywood sells the idea that the US are world saviors, who in this case, come for the liberation of the poor Colombian people. 
There is even a scene where the agent says "now they had something to fear: us!"  USA played a role in it, but don't take everything at face value.

Colombians, as you can see in the more accurate "Escobar, el patrón del mal" (produced in Colombia), were very strong and able to unite against a very powerful enemy, the illegal drug industry.
28/12/15, 11:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: How's the holiday, Rodrigo?
28/12/15, 11:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: Some nice photos there.
28/12/15, 11:17 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Good explanation Rodrigo
28/12/15, 11:35 PM - Alex K: You opened a lot of doors Rodrigo, which id love to discuss when we're all back in Montreal. Do you know if you can get the movie you referred to with subtitles?
28/12/15, 11:38 PM - Leon Montiel: Is not a movie, is a series of about 80 episodes. But maybe you can get the subtitles, not sure
29/12/15, 12:07 AM - Adnan Waheed: Hey Ali, happy birthday!

29/12/15, 7:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Nah, it's all gone next week. Summer is around the corner.
29/12/15, 7:51 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: More seriously the snow removal should be done by jan 3rd.
29/12/15, 7:51 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: After that very little snow on the sidewalk and almost no snow on the street.
29/12/15, 7:52 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: However there is always one or two people that get hit by the snow removal truck each year. So be extremely careful.
29/12/15, 7:53 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Those guys work long hour and drive fast (especially the truck that carry the snow away).

31/12/15, 5:58 PM - Sumeet Singh: Attention please:
Today is December 31, 2015
31 + 12 + 15 = 58
Its the 21st century:
21x 58 = 1218
Now we add the two Numbers:
1218 + 2015 = 3233
As you can see this number has no meaning at all.
Thanks for your attention.
31/12/15, 6:03 PM - Eric Galas: Hahaha
31/12/15, 6:04 PM - LG Krishna Canada: It has no meaning? 😱 But I've made plans...

04/01/16, 11:35 AM - Ali Akerman: Vikram that means if you have class on Mondays you go to those on this upcoming Thursday
04/01/16, 1:18 PM - Yatin: Ok..so does that mean on Friday we follow Tuesday schedule and so on?
04/01/16, 1:19 PM - Yatin: or do we reset on Monday to Monday again?
04/01/16, 1:19 PM - Yash Sinha: No more classes on Friday
04/01/16, 1:19 PM - Yash Sinha: Resets on Monday
04/01/16, 1:33 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Woah that would have been super confusing Yatin...
04/01/16, 1:37 PM - Eric Galas: If I remember correctly from undergrad they do this because lots of holiday happen on Mondays so it's a way to make up for a lecture which would be lost to holiday otherwise

05/01/16, 11:08 AM - Vikram Hooda: Can I still drop out
05/01/16, 11:08 AM - Yash Sinha: It's kind of a mandatory part of your degree
05/01/16, 11:08 AM - Kristov: It's worth 6 credits so presumably you'd have to make them up in other classes
05/01/16, 11:10 AM - Vikram Hooda: Ya thats what I heard u can take other classes if u want
05/01/16, 11:10 AM - Vikram Hooda: M kinda sure about it

06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Sumeet Singh: Just when you say things couldn't be worse, god takes it as a challenge
06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Who said that?
06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Scott Fulton: Sumeet often talks to himself
06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Oh kk
06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Carry on Sumeet
06/01/16, 9:04 PM - Sumeet Singh: I did, while looking at my transcript before m&g
06/01/16, 9:05 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😢
06/01/16, 9:24 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Changing the subject....
Can the puck be conducted by foot on hockey? Like soccer!?
06/01/16, 9:25 PM - Sumeet Singh: I think it is done to stop it or block it..
06/01/16, 9:25 PM - Ryan Shields: Not kicked into the net
06/01/16, 9:25 PM - Ryan Shields: But redirected
06/01/16, 9:25 PM - Ryan Shields: All other foot use is allowee
06/01/16, 9:25 PM - Sumeet Singh: Ye... I was close.. Awesome
06/01/16, 9:28 PM - Scott Fulton: Well put Ryan. There are actually discussions about allowing kicking if the skate doesn't leave the ice through the motion. Has not happened yet
06/01/16, 9:29 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: We should create a stickless hockey...
Sockey!
06/01/16, 9:30 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: I just saw the Canadien guy kicking the puck... It just make so much more sence
06/01/16, 9:30 PM - Scott Fulton: Hayoo!! But let's not...hockey is amazing
06/01/16, 9:32 PM - Angela Hernandez: Does anyone know if there is still a place to donate a winter jackets?
06/01/16, 9:33 PM - Angela Hernandez: Winter jacket
06/01/16, 9:40 PM - Yatin: I believe Sarah sent an email with a link where you could donate earlier during last semester
06/01/16, 9:41 PM - Angela Hernandez: I'll look for it thanks 😊
06/01/16, 9:41 PM - Yatin: On another note, I need some first time skiing advice from the professionals here..Is there a size for a ski and the sticks that go with it or one size fits all?
06/01/16, 9:42 PM - Yatin: And what kind of preparations do I need for first time?...
06/01/16, 9:43 PM - Yatin: There are some cheap skies  going out there on free and for sale and I am wondering to get my hands on one of them
06/01/16, 9:43 PM - Scott Fulton: Advice, take the lesson. Fitting is crucial and go with the rentals.
06/01/16, 9:44 PM - Scott Fulton: First time preparations, don't lean back, ski on the balls of your feet and get a helmet haha
06/01/16, 9:45 PM - Yatin: Sounds good! I just want to make it back in one piece..
06/01/16, 9:46 PM - Scott Fulton: Haha you'll be fine. Nothing dangerous on the mountains here. Just stick to the bunny hill (beginner section) and take it easy.
06/01/16, 9:47 PM - Yatin: Cheers buddy, bunny it will be!
06/01/16, 9:48 PM - Ali Akerman: Agreed definitely rent before you buy
06/01/16, 9:48 PM - Ali Akerman: There are different kind of skis
06/01/16, 9:48 PM - Ali Akerman: And Scott is right. Take lessons the first time
06/01/16, 9:49 PM - Ali Akerman: Also for the others who want a good deal, there is a store in Montreal called "la poubelle à skis" that sells new, out of season gear
06/01/16, 9:49 PM - Scott Fulton: Also, choose skiing over snowboarding for the first time. It's much more natural to learn
06/01/16, 9:49 PM - Ali Akerman: Not the best stuff but very affordable
06/01/16, 9:51 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: What would be the balls of one feet?
06/01/16, 9:52 PM - Scott Fulton: One's feet balls would be the part after the arch before the toes haha
06/01/16, 9:52 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Oh... Living and learning!
06/01/16, 9:53 PM - Scott Fulton: Great way to do it
06/01/16, 9:53 PM - Yatin: Haha..Thanks Ali!

06/01/16, 10:11 PM - Sumeet Singh: I may or may not have a meme bank, but let's look at the bigger picture here. What do we all have as a bank?
06/01/16, 10:11 PM - Adnan Waheed: I dunno. Some people have a wank bank. But not me. Oh, no.
06/01/16, 10:32 PM - Ali Akerman: Hahahaha "a wank bank"

07/01/16, 10:15 AM - Samira Khajehi: There's an ebook you can get or pick up in store
07/01/16, 10:17 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey concerning the flight tickets to Singapore: if you are buying a staralliance flight I can give you a 50$ rebate. Why? When I was travelling to costa rica last summer I got two 600 USD voucher because of one flight that was overbooked. And I took the voucher in exchange of some debt from the trip. How it works : when you are about to buy to ticket, if it's a star alliance (i.e. united) you call me and I give you the code for the voucher. Then you write me a cheque for 600 USD minus 50$ for the inconvenience.
07/01/16, 10:18 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: So just before you buy, give me a call!
07/01/16, 10:19 AM - Alex K: I'm guessing this is only for one individual?
07/01/16, 10:19 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Correct
07/01/16, 10:20 AM - Gul Kurtar: Let the hunger games begin
07/01/16, 10:21 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Just think about it when you buy the ticket.. It's only 50$. Nothing to start ripping each other head off.. Haha
07/01/16, 10:23 AM - Rodrigo Gosende: Thanks Samira!
07/01/16, 10:26 AM - Alex K: That's at least 5 pints

07/01/16, 12:26 PM - Ali Akerman: From Bloomberg, Jan 7, 2016, 5:52:44 PM
For most people, going to business school leads to bigger and bigger paychecks. But you are likely to get the most out of the degree if you are a white or Asian man, Bloomberg data show.

10/01/16, 5:50 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Having already watched the movie, I've decided to spoil the fun for all of you. The movie is about 8 strangers being stranded in a cabin. 5 of them are vampires, 2 of them are aliens and 1 of them is a republican. The Republican bans all of them from using the cabin. That's pretty much the movie. You're welcome. Have fun!
10/01/16, 5:50 PM - Yash Sinha: No, but it is epic
10/01/16, 5:51 PM - Adnan Waheed: Fuck off, LGK!

11/01/16, 8:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: Appreciate this, Sumeet, but I don't trust this because it doesn't show me one of my registered classes.
11/01/16, 8:09 PM - Sumeet Singh: Hmm... what if we had a tool that let us generate calendars by selecting courses?
11/01/16, 8:10 PM - Adnan Waheed: I don't know, and I'm not bothered. I've got everything sorted out on my Google calendar already. But do appreciate the info. Ya never know when it can come in handy.
11/01/16, 8:11 PM - Sumeet Singh: Well, all right then.
11/01/16, 8:12 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Don't we already have such a tool?

12/01/16, 9:40 AM - Eric Galas: Mostly McGill
12/01/16, 9:41 AM - Eric Galas: They preach a family, collaborative atmosphere... Consulting with a personal life balance
12/01/16, 9:42 AM - Samira Khajehi: Much fewer travel commitments. And they work on multiple projects at once
12/01/16, 10:03 AM - Sara Mahabadi: Where you there Scott?!
12/01/16, 10:20 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I tried talking french to one of the managers...to try to impress her. I think I scared her away.

12/01/16, 10:32 AM - Adnan Waheed: The only one long full sentence I know in French is: Voulez vous coucher avec moi c'est soir. Was that the one you used, Nirros?
12/01/16, 10:33 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: LOOOL
12/01/16, 10:33 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: No I don't think so
12/01/16, 10:34 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: You actually made a grammar mistake that make the sentence sound even funnier.
12/01/16, 10:34 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: 'Do you you want to sleep with me, it's late"
12/01/16, 10:35 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Instead of 'tonight'
12/01/16, 10:35 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: ( c'est soir vs. ce soir)
12/01/16, 10:36 AM - Rodrigo Gosende: Doesn't Ce soir and c'est soir sound the same?
12/01/16, 10:37 AM - Rodrigo Gosende: *Don't

12/01/16, 1:06 PM - Vikram Hooda: Or double
12/01/16, 1:07 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I think you might want to ask Derek Hart. But I think it's more a question of substance than quantity
12/01/16, 4:48 PM - Saleh: what a class it will be tonight. love the snow
12/01/16, 4:51 PM - Parker Donaldson: Is anyone taking 5 courses this semester?
12/01/16, 4:54 PM - Adnan Waheed: Me. Sort of.
12/01/16, 4:54 PM - Parker Donaldson: ...go on.
12/01/16, 4:55 PM - Adnan Waheed: Three 3-credit courses and two 1.5-credit courses.
12/01/16, 4:55 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I am as well
12/01/16, 4:55 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Not sort of though
12/01/16, 4:56 PM - Sumeet Singh: Nirros - setting impossible standards for everyone since 2015
12/01/16, 4:58 PM - Yash Sinha: I am, sort of - 4 registered, 1 unregistered
12/01/16, 4:59 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Lol Sumeet...you're my role model
12/01/16, 5:01 PM - Parker Donaldson: So 5 courses is a great idea then. Strength thru numbers. And a bit of a Confirmation bias.
12/01/16, 5:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Yup definitely
12/01/16, 5:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: We got this
12/01/16, 5:04 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I strategically avoided classes with heavy readings though 😶
12/01/16, 9:10 PM - Sumeet Singh: https://youtu.be/1EBfxjSFAxQ
12/01/16, 9:11 PM - Sumeet Singh: For your reference, Adnan
12/01/16, 9:19 PM - Adnan Waheed: Haha. I don't know what I sound like, but I'm not sure if I sound like him.
12/01/16, 9:35 PM - Sumeet Singh: Sure you don't
12/01/16, 10:13 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: We have a MMCC meeting tomorrow???
12/01/16, 10:13 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Ohh shoot WC
12/01/16, 10:16 PM - Samira Khajehi: You should be meeting the toilet regularly Rodrigo
12/01/16, 10:18 PM - Yash Sinha: An English lady, while visiting Switzerland, was looking for a room, and she asked the schoolmaster if he could recommend any to her. He took her to see several rooms, and when everything was settled, the lady returned to her home to make the final preparations to move.

When she arrived home, the thought suddenly occurred to her that she had not seen a “W.C.” [water closet, a euphemism for toilet] around the place. So she immediately wrote a note to the schoolmaster asking him if there were a “W.C.” around. The [Swiss] schoolmaster was a very poor student of English, so he asked the [Swiss] parish priest if he could help in the matter. Together they tried to discover the meaning of the letters “W.C.,” and the only solution they could find for the letters was “Wayside Chapel.” The schoolmaster then wrote to the English lady the following note:

Dear Madam:
I take great pleasure in informing you that the W.C. is situated nine miles from the house you occupy, in the center of a beautiful grove of pine trees surrounded by lovely grounds. It is capable of holding 229 people and it is open on Sunday and Thursday only. As there are a great number of people and they are expected during the summer months, I would suggest that you come early: although there is plenty of standing room as a rule. You will no doubt be glad to hear that a good number of people bring their lunch and make a day of it; while others who can afford to go by car arrive just in time. I would especially recommend that your ladyship go on Thursday when there is a musical accompaniment. It may interest you to know that my daughter was married in the W.C. and it was there that she met her husband. I can remember the rush there was for seats. There were ten people to a seat ordinarily occupied by one. It was wonderful to see the expression on their faces. The newest attraction is a bell donated by a wealthy resident of the district. It rings every time a person enters. A bazaar is to be held to provide plush seats for all the people, since they feel it is a long felt need. My wife is rather delicate, so she can’t attend regularly. I shall be delighted to reserve the best seat for you if you wish, where you will be seen by all. For the children, there is a special time and place so that they will not disturb the elders. Hoping to have been of service to you, I remain,
Sincerely,
The Schoolmaster

12/01/16, 11:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: He showed me his meme bank today.
12/01/16, 11:08 PM - Sumeet Singh: That is NOT a euphemism, guys.
12/01/16, 11:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: What is not a euphemism, guys?
12/01/16, 11:08 PM - Sumeet Singh: Go Adnan, drunk. You're home.
12/01/16, 11:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: Hokay.
12/01/16, 11:09 PM - Sumit Kalawat: <Media omitted>

12/01/16, 11:14 PM - Sumeet Singh: Well played, gentlemen.
12/01/16, 11:30 PM - Yatin: I am also going for Saturday only
13/01/16, 12:44 AM - Kristov: @yash your story reminded me of this http://youtu.be/gmOTpIVxji8
13/01/16, 9:12 AM - Eric Galas: For those that were in marketing management 2 last night, can anyone confirm if Prof said he was no longer teaching the class after this semester or if only the name of the class was changing? I didn't quite catch that part
13/01/16, 9:14 AM - Karen Sidhu: I believe he said he's not longer teaching that class
13/01/16, 9:14 AM - Eric Galas: Thank Karen
13/01/16, 9:59 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey guys, technical question regarding dropping classes: the deadline is jan 19th right? It means that I can drop a class on tuesday night, right?
13/01/16, 9:59 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Just want to be sure and not have a W on my transcript. Haha
13/01/16, 10:08 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Ok I guess I will ask Mona and let you know. But I have another question, I have 300$ of new fees that I owe McGill. Do you know where all those copyright fees come from?
13/01/16, 10:10 AM - Anchal Raghuwanshi: I think that was the fee of the course packs
13/01/16, 10:12 AM - Ali Akerman: Is it positive or negative $300?
13/01/16, 10:13 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I owe an extra 328.09$
13/01/16, 10:13 AM - Ali Akerman: I have a negative amount on mine which should mean that the university owes me
13/01/16, 10:13 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I got charged 5 coursepack copyright fees on december 23rd ( my birthday )
13/01/16, 10:14 AM - Ali Akerman: You should drop whatever it is you want to drop before you pay that
13/01/16, 10:14 AM - Ali Akerman: It might fluctuate
13/01/16, 10:14 AM - Ali Akerman: Haha what a great gift
13/01/16, 10:15 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Mmhh.. So that's what I thought it's copyright fees for the winter semester.. But why do I need to pay for the ebook again? Am I doing something wrong?
13/01/16, 10:15 AM - Daisy: So we basically pay for the rights then again pay to purchase the ebook ?
13/01/16, 10:15 AM - Daisy: Oh same question 😊
13/01/16, 10:15 AM - Ali Akerman: I don't think it's the ebook
13/01/16, 10:16 AM - Ali Akerman: It should be the cases and stuff like that
13/01/16, 10:16 AM - Vivek Rai Canada: Afaik.. The fee is for the copyright.. Then you purchase the ebook
13/01/16, 10:17 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: But the only cost of the ebook is copyright
13/01/16, 10:17 AM - Ali Akerman: How much is this ebook?
13/01/16, 10:18 AM - Vivek Rai Canada: I had the same discussion with Yash yesterday.. Apparently they had the same issue last year
13/01/16, 10:19 AM - Vivek Rai Canada: Guillaume.. You can ask ziv about it.. He discussed this with the faculty last year
13/01/16, 10:19 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha if ziv did not fix it, it's unfixable
13/01/16, 10:20 AM - Vivek Rai Canada: Ebook should be around $48.. I guess it'll vary for every course
13/01/16, 10:20 AM - Ali Akerman: I highly doubt they'd charge a copyright fee on an ebook directly into your student account. What if you already had the book before you came to McGill. Also I don't think it's legal to sell a book without the copyrights attached and then charge it independently.
13/01/16, 10:21 AM - Ali Akerman: My best guess is that it is for course content
13/01/16, 10:21 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: So we are 100% sure it's cost related to winter semester. In this case I should wait before looking the figure. It will vary when I drop those classes
13/01/16, 10:21 AM - Deepti Kaul: I got the same thing- it is copyright fees for coursepacks.. I don't know about you but I'm still registered for more courses than I'm going to be taking so I'm only going to pay how much I owe once my courses are finalized as the sum will likely shrink
13/01/16, 10:21 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yes
13/01/16, 10:22 AM - Gul Kurtar: What happens if we paid for it and dropped courses afterwards, do we get reimbursed?
13/01/16, 10:23 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: No, they keep the money and name a building after you
13/01/16, 10:24 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: More seriousle :Just the bill amount is negative. I am not sure if you get a re-imbursement or just a credit for the following semester

14/01/16, 12:27 PM - Eric Galas: Hi everyone I just got out of a meeting with Sujata and I asked about Intl trip... Don't worry about visas, courriers and all that right now the faculty takes care of it (in the sense they tell what you need to provide and by when and then send it off for us all) however if you want to start on your own go ahead or wait until more info comes from the faculty
14/01/16, 12:27 PM - Eric Galas: Hope that helps clarify any concerns

14/01/16, 2:20 PM - Karen Sidhu: Also, I've been speaking with the PMBAs and I know a lot of us are in the process of forming our study groups for Singapore but keep in mind that we do need to have one PMBA per group so try to limit your groups to a maximum of 5 unless you have already coordinated with a PMBA student. Once we have more information I'll start a group sign up sheet so we can make sure all groups are complete :)

20/01/16, 10:03 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I was wondering why real estate is not collapsing in Canada : www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ae4dee44-bf34-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html
20/01/16, 10:03 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Almost 800G$ escaped from China last year
20/01/16, 11:09 AM - Adnan Waheed: 800G$? 800 Gazillion Dollars? 800 Guillermo Dollars?
20/01/16, 11:12 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: When you say 800k it means 800 thousands right?
20/01/16, 11:12 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: M millions?
20/01/16, 11:13 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: G = 10 to the power 9
20/01/16, 11:13 AM - Yash Sinha: Giga aka Billion
20/01/16, 11:13 AM - Adnan Waheed: Who says 800 Giga Dollars?
20/01/16, 11:14 AM - Yash Sinha: Troo engineers
20/01/16, 11:20 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's common in french and I have seen it in Europe. The reason is that in some languages the million and billion start with the same letter.  Where does k for thousand come from anyways? SI notation system.
20/01/16, 11:21 AM - Gul Kurtar: G for google
20/01/16, 11:23 AM - Adnan Waheed: Ok, sir, I'll put the giga in my vocabulary.
20/01/16, 11:23 AM - Scott Fulton: Would you call millions mega dollars guillaume?
20/01/16, 11:24 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Do you call lbs pound?
20/01/16, 11:24 AM - Scott Fulton: Lol
20/01/16, 11:24 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Sometimes you don't read what is written and it's ok.. Hehe
20/01/16, 11:24 AM - Scott Fulton: It's an interesting point. K is kilo but then we jump to millions and billions
20/01/16, 11:25 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: But you never say kilo dollars..
20/01/16, 11:25 AM - Adnan Waheed: Maybe the engineers do.
20/01/16, 11:25 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I should start saying that when negociating my salary
20/01/16, 11:25 AM - Scott Fulton: Exactly! That's why it's an interesting thing
20/01/16, 11:25 AM - Scott Fulton: Hahaha just to negotiate confuse the shot out of them
20/01/16, 11:26 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Even more confusing, in french billion actually stand for trillion in french.
20/01/16, 11:26 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: *English
20/01/16, 11:27 AM - Scott Fulton: Lol
20/01/16, 11:27 AM - Scott Fulton: Just speak québécois to the recruiter and they're certain to get confused
20/01/16, 11:27 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: In spanish as well. Actually there no word for billion, they just call it thousands of millions..
20/01/16, 11:27 AM - Scott Fulton: Same with Korean
20/01/16, 11:28 AM - Scott Fulton: They only have 10k as the max and then it's multiples
20/01/16, 11:28 AM - Scott Fulton: Like a million is a thousand thousands
20/01/16, 11:28 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Languages were not made to handle large numbers haha
20/01/16, 11:29 AM - Scott Fulton: Going in multiples is the most logical though
20/01/16, 11:29 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Same in India as well, they have crore and lakh I think..
20/01/16, 11:29 AM - Gaurav McGill: Yup
20/01/16, 11:30 AM - Scott Fulton: If I said what's a million divided by 1000 it would take a second but if you thought what's a thousand thousands divided by a thousand it's way easier
20/01/16, 11:30 AM - Gaurav McGill: And arab after crore
20/01/16, 11:30 AM - Rodrigo Gosende: In Brazil we can count to many gazillions, inflation taught us how to do it
20/01/16, 11:31 AM - Scott Fulton: Is that counting your interest expense? Haha
20/01/16, 11:31 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
20/01/16, 11:32 AM - Adnan Waheed: You're Charp, Guillermo!
20/01/16, 11:32 AM - Rodrigo Gosende: Thats counting how fast your money is no longer money
20/01/16, 11:33 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: In mexico they regularly take zeros off the currency.  Maybe you could do that instead of all being millionaires.
20/01/16, 1:13 PM - Yash Sinha: There's delicious fried rice being served in the basement for $5
20/01/16, 1:13 PM - Adnan Waheed: I had the quinoa, kale, and avocado salad. Delicious!
20/01/16, 1:14 PM - Adnan Waheed: Also in the basement. Also $5.
20/01/16, 1:14 PM - Eric Galas: I had the chicken version, delicious
20/01/16, 1:17 PM - Sumeet Singh: I had the 'smart burger'. Delicious.
20/01/16, 1:19 PM - Adnan Waheed: I like them too, Sumeet, but I keep them to either before or after gym time. Not the cleanest food.
20/01/16, 4:12 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Thanks for the support guys. You are the best!!!!!
20/01/16, 4:39 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I missed that?
20/01/16, 4:39 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: No!!!
20/01/16, 7:14 PM - Adnan Waheed: Anybody know how to check what mentor I've got?
20/01/16, 7:18 PM - Rita Komarova: you should have received an email from Fiona. if not, email her to ask about it
20/01/16, 7:27 PM - Adnan Waheed: I've got emails from her but she never once mentioned who the mentor is. I'm gonna email her. Thanks, madame!
20/01/16, 7:46 PM - Vikram Hooda: Whats the mentor for ??
20/01/16, 7:47 PM - Adnan Waheed: It's only relevant if you've signed up for the programme.
20/01/16, 7:47 PM - Vikram Hooda: Oohhhkkkk
20/01/16, 9:49 PM - Sumeet Singh: Congratulations to everyone who got an interview at Capital One.
I understand that some of you need some help doing cases.
If you would like some practice material or case practice, we can arrange it for you. Please get in touch with Scott Fulton, Christian Mathews-Gagné, Rodrigo Gosende, or me.
21/01/16, 10:23 AM - Parker Donaldson: Question about Singapore trip. Are we staying at the Four Seasons?
21/01/16, 10:24 AM - Eric Galas: I think it is the Four Points curtesy Alex M. (joke; just so no one takes my post seriously, I don't know where we are staying)
21/01/16, 10:25 AM - Eric Galas: Not nearly as effective if I need to clarify its a joke, damn
21/01/16, 10:52 AM - Angela Hernandez: 😁 it made sense for the ones I talent management
21/01/16, 11:08 AM - Ali Akerman: Whatsapp chats are binding contracts as far as I'm concerned Mr. President
21/01/16, 11:09 AM - Caroline: 👍
21/01/16, 11:13 AM - Eric Galas: Haha, that was my fear Ali
21/01/16, 2:41 PM - Ali Akerman: Guys we were told that finals would take place on the weekend of April 16-17
21/01/16, 2:44 PM - Ali Akerman: I'm going to talk to Dina and Sujata at 4pm because based on what was told to us about the trip, it is very unexpected that exams would be on a weekend
21/01/16, 2:44 PM - Ankit Balyan: Finals for which course?
21/01/16, 2:44 PM - Ali Akerman: Let me know if this is a concern for any of you
21/01/16, 2:45 PM - Ali Akerman: For several courses
21/01/16, 2:45 PM - Ali Akerman: We have FINE 646 at 9:30am on the 17th
21/01/16, 2:46 PM - Catherine Dupont: I think the reason is its on a Sunday is maybe to give us a day off between exams - in which case it works for me!
21/01/16, 3:11 PM - Alex K: @Ali if they can be switched to before the weekend that'd be great.
21/01/16, 3:14 PM - Alex K: Apologies, I'm not in 646, so don't have a say, but if any other classes are affected please let us know.
21/01/16, 3:36 PM - Ali Akerman: I think many people are worried about the finals being on the weekend
21/01/16, 3:36 PM - Ali Akerman: It's not just for 646
21/01/16, 3:36 PM - Ali Akerman: I'll let you know when I talk to them
21/01/16, 4:28 PM - ‪+1 (438) 828-0027‬: the Four Seasons ain't no Four Points!
21/01/16, 5:05 PM - Yatin: I was just about to book my Singapore ticket this afternoon for the 16th Apr
21/01/16, 5:06 PM - Yatin: Guess I should hold off..
21/01/16, 5:07 PM - Angela Hernandez: Do you have any exam on those days? I have none so in the 16 I will be in an ✈️
21/01/16, 5:07 PM - Yatin: well only the MCF date is unclear
21/01/16, 5:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: How do you know you have none?
21/01/16, 5:21 PM - Ali Akerman: Mcf is not on Friday
21/01/16, 5:21 PM - Ali Akerman: Best guess is Saturday
21/01/16, 5:21 PM - Ali Akerman: Dina told me that their hands were tied
21/01/16, 5:21 PM - Alex K: Why would they do that right before the trip?
21/01/16, 5:22 PM - Ali Akerman: But I kindly told her that it is ridiculous to expect us to finish classes on Thursday
21/01/16, 5:22 PM - Ali Akerman: Have finals Friday Saturday and Sunday
21/01/16, 5:22 PM - Ali Akerman: And then leave to Singapore on Monday
21/01/16, 5:23 PM - Ali Akerman: Which we will have to because we need to be there on Tuesday and hit the ground running
21/01/16, 5:23 PM - Ali Akerman: There apparently is also work to be done before the trip. Group work and workshops
21/01/16, 5:23 PM - Ali Akerman: I am going to email Sujata for a meeting.
21/01/16, 5:23 PM - Alex K: Agreed, it's a bit absurd to be fair.
21/01/16, 5:24 PM - Kristov: Absurdity isn't always uncommon in this program.
21/01/16, 5:25 PM - Parker Donaldson: Maybe "go ahead and book your tickets now" wasn't the best advice...
21/01/16, 5:25 PM - Ali Akerman: I have a derivatives class on Wednesday and the final on Friday. All the while I am learning new material on Thursday for a final on Sunday
21/01/16, 5:25 PM - Ali Akerman: Dina told me that we apparently weren't supposed to.
21/01/16, 5:25 PM - Gul Kurtar: Lol kristov
21/01/16, 5:25 PM - Parker Donaldson: We'll surprise you with workshops and exams later - and also, we will not inform some of your professora
21/01/16, 5:32 PM - Alex K: Ali, keep us in the loop of any developments and if you need additional help, let us know.
21/01/16, 5:35 PM - Ali Akerman: Thanks and will do
21/01/16, 5:35 PM - Ali Akerman: Sujata wasnt able to make it to the meeting today
21/01/16, 5:35 PM - Ali Akerman: I asked to meet separately at her convenience.
21/01/16, 5:35 PM - Ali Akerman: I'll let you know as soon as I know
21/01/16, 5:36 PM - Alex K: Cheers
21/01/16, 5:43 PM - Adnan Waheed: Thanks, Ali. Much appreciated!
21/01/16, 5:44 PM - Adnan Waheed: On another note, has anyone been to a scotch tasting event here at Thomson?
21/01/16, 5:48 PM - Karen Sidhu: No but I've heard the 5 a 7 there tonight is pretty fun
21/01/16, 5:56 PM - Christian Gagne: Funny I heard the same
21/01/16, 6:00 PM - Adnan Waheed: I'd like to go but I'd just be standing in a corner because I'd know no one.
21/01/16, 6:01 PM - Adnan Waheed: Any feedback on the scotch tasting? They have one again on the 29th and I wanna go. But I'm wondering if it's worth the time.
21/01/16, 6:03 PM - Christian Gagne: I believe Alex Martino was thinking of organizing one of his own
21/01/16, 6:04 PM - Christian Gagne: I remember mention of rich mahogany and leather-bound books
21/01/16, 6:07 PM - Adnan Waheed: Good to know. I'll bother him with that.
21/01/16, 6:53 PM - Yatin: On a completely random note, what happened with the Lipdib video?
21/01/16, 6:53 PM - Yatin: When can I get it to show off my moves to other people? :)
21/01/16, 7:07 PM - Alex K: It's in the process of being edited. We will have a release soon. More updates to come.
21/01/16, 7:16 PM - Christian Gagne: Soon* is a relative term
21/01/16, 7:16 PM - Christian Gagne: (Disclaimer)
21/01/16, 7:17 PM - Gul Kurtar: Let's go to scotch tasting
21/01/16, 7:20 PM - Alex K: Haha, yeah thanks Christian.
21/01/16, 7:22 PM - Adnan Waheed: That's the spirit, Gul!
21/01/16, 7:22 PM - Gul Kurtar: Lol sorry wasn't expecting that
21/01/16, 7:22 PM - Gul Kurtar: But it's a good plan!
21/01/16, 7:22 PM - Gul Kurtar: Im excited
21/01/16, 7:23 PM - Karen Sidhu: <Media omitted>
21/01/16, 7:23 PM - Karen Sidhu: You and me

21/01/16, 8:15 PM - Adnan Waheed: <Media omitted>
21/01/16, 8:17 PM - Adnan Waheed: PS. I don't completely trust this because many decent countries are missing and China has made the cut.
21/01/16, 8:18 PM - Eric Galas: 1-2 looks pretty good to me
21/01/16, 8:20 PM - Yash Sinha: But but theladbible seems like sick a trustworthy source
21/01/16, 8:21 PM - Adnan Waheed: Super trustworthy!
21/01/16, 8:22 PM - Leon Montiel: I mean if it is from the internet it must be true
21/01/16, 8:23 PM - Leon Montiel: <Media omitted>
21/01/16, 8:30 PM - Adnan Waheed: <Media omitted>
21/01/16, 8:31 PM - Leon Montiel: Hahaha, that one is new to me
21/01/16, 8:32 PM - Adnan Waheed: Also, the next time I want you to say 'duck'. It's an experiment.
21/01/16, 8:40 PM - Angela Hernandez: 🙄 not liking your experiment Adnan
22/01/16, 11:00 AM - Saleh: <Media omitted>
22/01/16, 11:13 AM - Saleh: update: it seems it wont lol

22/01/16, 2:44 PM - Andrew Mutrie: That's my favourite house in Montreal
22/01/16, 2:45 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Everyone, reminder to come one come all to an outdoor skate Tuesday evening in e old port! We will leave school around 530, and go for a friendly casual beginner oriented skate in truly magical settings. ... Analogous to a magic carpet ride!
22/01/16, 6:07 PM - Sara Mahabadi: Hi guys, I've lost my usb, it is green and white... Please let me know if you find it in lounge or any of the classes, thanks
22/01/16, 9:35 PM - Adnan Waheed: http://www.unilad.co.uk/food/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-eating-meat/
Vegetarian propaganda..

24/01/16, 3:40 PM - Sarah Lee: Come watch the team play!
24/01/16, 7:08 PM - Andrew Mutrie: The whole team looks just great out there in the red pinnies.
24/01/16, 7:45 PM - Eric Galas: Win yes?
24/01/16, 7:45 PM - Scott Fulton: Ask Sarah
24/01/16, 7:46 PM - Eric Galas: You played... Wouldn't that be easier?
24/01/16, 7:47 PM - Scott Fulton: Haha it's an inside joke. We won but she was on her phone the whole time and then at the end of the game we convinced her we lost
24/01/16, 7:49 PM - Eric Galas: Hahaha well played
24/01/16, 7:50 PM - Eric Galas: At least there was a fan👍
24/01/16, 7:50 PM - Scott Fulton: It was a dusting
24/01/16, 7:50 PM - Scott Fulton: Like 60-20
24/01/16, 7:53 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: Looks like everyone's following the instructions of president Scott! Show no mercy!
24/01/16, 7:53 PM - Scott Fulton: lol so true
24/01/16, 7:53 PM - Scott Fulton: If you're not first you're last
24/01/16, 8:15 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Scooters high again
24/01/16, 8:18 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Scott, business school has changed you!
24/01/16, 9:00 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Scott was channeling his inner Jordan.  Dunks on Dunks.
24/01/16, 9:59 PM - Sarah Lee: Lol...in my defense...I was the only fan!
24/01/16, 9:59 PM - Sarah Lee: So bonus points 😊😊
24/01/16, 10:18 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Hey guys, ft mba ranking just came up
24/01/16, 10:18 PM - Samira Khajehi: Where are we on it?
24/01/16, 10:18 PM - Yash Sinha: Are we on it?
24/01/16, 10:19 PM - Sumeet Singh: We on it?
24/01/16, 10:19 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😱
24/01/16, 10:19 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yes
24/01/16, 10:19 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Actually pretty impressive
24/01/16, 10:19 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😎
24/01/16, 10:20 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: #2 in Canada
24/01/16, 10:20 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: And went up 15 spots
24/01/16, 10:20 PM - Ankit Balyan: wohooo 😀
24/01/16, 10:20 PM - Neha Karnad: http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-ranking-2016
24/01/16, 10:21 PM - Rita Komarova: hell yah guys! very impressive jump from #100 to #85
24/01/16, 10:23 PM - Sumeet Singh: They think Rotman is #1???
24/01/16, 10:23 PM - Sumeet Singh: <Media omitted>
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Ankit Balyan: Rotman has fallen 7 ranks
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Yash Sinha: FT rankings give a very high weightage to salary, and salary is higher in Toronto
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Where's concordia at though
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Ankit Balyan: But still quite above
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Ankit Balyan: I dont think they even go there
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Ankit Balyan: 😂
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Who is concordia?
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Yash Sinha: Concordia isn't even good enough to be at the MBA Games
24/01/16, 10:24 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 💔
24/01/16, 10:25 PM - Yash Sinha: But that's for the MBA program, I'm sure their engineering is swell
24/01/16, 10:26 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: 😅
24/01/16, 10:44 PM - Adnan Waheed: I'm gonna be brutally honest. Not many people know of Concordia outside of Canada. I had no idea what Concordia was until I moved here.
24/01/16, 10:49 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Not many people outside of Quebec know of Concordia actually..
24/01/16, 10:50 PM - Rita Komarova: very true, Nirros
24/01/16, 10:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's sad, because they have great infrastructure and a great quality of education( at the undergrad particularly) but they live in the shadow of the other anglophone school in mtl.
24/01/16, 10:50 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Jmsb building is pretty impressive for example
24/01/16, 10:52 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Each time I went to Toronto in my undergrad years, my relatives would often ask me if I go to Mcgill. I would say Concordia, they thought I was in trade school or something 😢
24/01/16, 10:52 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha
24/01/16, 10:52 PM - Yash Sinha: They're growing, it's still a pretty new University, give them time and I'm sure they'll get there since everyone seems to agree that they're doing the right things
25/01/16, 12:20 AM - Bryan Au: It seems the Chinese love to send their kids there
25/01/16, 12:23 AM - Nathalie: On friday I had a conversation with a concordia student and she told me how some classes were held in a basement under dollarama - and that engineering phds were not necessarily good at teaching...
25/01/16, 12:23 AM - Nathalie: But yes, jmsb building looks good...
25/01/16, 12:31 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Yah that's the FG building... and those are the teaching assistants from Iran,  India and China that don't have work permits so are TAs for the money 😅
25/01/16, 12:31 AM - Adnan Waheed: Y'er controversial, Norris.
25/01/16, 12:31 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Having class under dollarama wasn't all bad. I was able to run up during my breaks and get cheap snacks.
25/01/16, 12:32 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Why Adnan?
25/01/16, 12:34 AM - Nathalie: Haha you actually lived it! 😁
25/01/16, 12:35 AM - Nirros Ponnudurai: You make it sound like I lived through world War 1 or something 😂
25/01/16, 12:44 AM - Bryan Au: Must have been traumatic
25/01/16, 10:59 AM - Eric Galas: for those in Strategies in Sustainable Development; anyone attending the Science for Sustainable Society Symposium, Tuesday night and Wednesday day?
25/01/16, 11:13 AM - Sara Mahabadi: I am
25/01/16, 11:27 AM - Eric Galas: ok great
25/01/16, 11:29 AM - Eric Galas: Anyone interested in The Taj for lunch?
25/01/16, 11:42 AM - Adnan Waheed: Heard they're a bit pricy.
25/01/16, 11:43 AM - Eric Galas: 17.95$ for lunch buffet
25/01/16, 11:44 AM - Adnan Waheed: That's not bad.
25/01/16, 10:13 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: General question: I just shook the hand of a guy, and they were wet. I am wondering : does this guys thinks everybody's hand are wet? Or he can feel the dryness through his wetness?
25/01/16, 10:14 PM - Samira Khajehi: He's probably embarrassed and was hoping you wouldn't tell anybody, let alone 70+ people
25/01/16, 10:14 PM - Scott Fulton: Maybe he was nervous...you're an intimidating fellow guillaume
25/01/16, 10:14 PM - Samira Khajehi: So tell us who he is!
25/01/16, 10:15 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: maybe he was just nervous..and that was sweat!
25/01/16, 10:15 PM - Angela Hernandez: At least you know he washed his hands after going to the toilet
25/01/16, 10:16 PM - Samira Khajehi: Or he went on his hands
25/01/16, 10:16 PM - Scott Fulton: Were they warm?
25/01/16, 10:16 PM - Yatin: Maybe he didn't really you and it was a good way to get back at you
25/01/16, 10:16 PM - Yatin: *like
25/01/16, 10:16 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: My palms get sweaty too sometimes 😐
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Samira Khajehi: Do your knees get weak?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Scott Fulton: And arms heavy?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Angela Hernandez: Was it Nirros?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Ryan Shields: Mom's spaghetti?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Scott Fulton: Nervous?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Samira Khajehi: Possible vomit on your sweater?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Scott Fulton: Dropping bombs?
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Yatin: Clearly we have nothing better to do
25/01/16, 10:17 PM - Samira Khajehi: Ahahhahahhaah
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: So many rappers in this group
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Samira Khajehi: Only one real slim shady
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Samira Khajehi: We know who that is
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Yatin: Please stand up
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Scott Fulton: Would they please stand up?
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Scott Fulton: Haha nice
25/01/16, 10:18 PM - Samira Khajehi: *stands up*
25/01/16, 10:19 PM - Nathalie: Hahah guys, be nice to Nirros! He's gonna get sweaty hands every time he sees one of us...
25/01/16, 10:20 PM - Nathalie: Nirros were you in the eminem part of the video?
25/01/16, 10:20 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: Loool 😢
25/01/16, 10:21 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: I was the crowd
25/01/16, 10:21 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: The crowd goes wild
25/01/16, 10:21 PM - Scott Fulton: And he went so loud!
25/01/16, 10:21 PM - Nirros Ponnudurai: With scott
25/01/16, 10:22 PM - Nathalie: 😂
25/01/16, 10:30 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha. I was just surprised by the hand shake. But I was more wondering about practical purposes.. It happens to me occasionally to have wet hands... But what if the other person has the hands wet too? Do you feel it through? Can you be sure the other person knows you have wet hand if themselves have wet hand

02/02/16, 11:09 PM - Sumeet Singh: Dear everyone,
I understand that we memers may have been making your life hell by texting stupid, trivial, stuff, and unfunny jokes in this chat, while you struggle to find  useful MBA related serious information, or the meaning of life, in this group.
02/02/16, 11:09 PM - Adnan Waheed: Isn't that what this group is all about - banter?
02/02/16, 11:09 PM - Sumeet Singh: We have, therefore, instituted a new Whatsapp group, specially reserved for  "the banter"
02/02/16, 11:10 PM - Sumeet Singh: @adnan - this is a different group, man. Read the title. Also, get off crack.
02/02/16, 11:11 PM - Sumeet Singh: @everyone else again - the "banter" group is where the jokes and the memes will be at
02/02/16, 11:12 PM - Sumeet Singh: This simplifies your life. You can part take in the banter group if you want by asking me, or rosie, or nirros, or yash.. Or not at all.. (Or leave later, whatever).. We don't judge.. And we don't care
02/02/16, 11:12 PM - Sumeet Singh: We shall let this group function as the serious talk group
02/02/16, 11:12 PM - Adnan Waheed: Pls stahp, Sumeet.

04/02/16, 9:25 PM - Akshay Kohli Canada: Issued in Public Interest: 
McKinsey’s Global MD Dominic Barton said that Technology grows three times faster than Management Practices. It is not easy to manage disruptive growth in technology with age old management practices. Hence, it is critical to understand what technology implies in a business environment. 
Whether you are in the financial sector or looking to be a consultant, a brand manager or an entrepreneur, or maybe just as a consumer, technology affects our life in a dramatic fashion. There is a reason technology is a horizontal and not a vertical in organisations. 
Last year the MBA 2’s tried to rejuvenate the technology club but couldn’t find the energy and passion to take it forward. We as future leaders of organizations and equal stakeholders in the impact this club can have to our lives and to future MBA’s share the responsibility to re-energize the club. I request all of you to become a member and “demand” your share of learning from the ‘McGill Technology Club’ to enhance your McGill experience. 
Please participate, become a member and your ‘McGill Technology club’ choose its new leadership on Monday, February 8th 2016 Time: 1200 to 1300 Bronfman 340. (Block Calendar now) 
You choose. You demand. Make time. Change future. 
Looking forward to see you all there! Thank you!! 
Show interest now!  https://www.facebook.com/events/1675573656055228/1676215585991035/

15/02/16, 10:46 PM - Gaurav McGill: Some of us McGill students (across various faculties) are planning to draft a resolution in support of Freedom of Expression and the Right of Indian Students to question and criticize the Indian government and its actions, without the fear of prosecution. This is in relation to some recent developments in India where students from one of the most prestigious University have been arrested and charged with anti-national activities for criticizing the Indian government and its actions. (I can fill you in with the details in person).
15/02/16, 10:46 PM - Gaurav McGill: We feel that in this hour of crisis for fellow students, we must express our solidarity and show our support to them, given McGill’s own ethos of fostering a liberal, open minded environment for students to question and learn. If you would like to be a part of this initiative, irrespective of your political leanings or nationality, please reach out to me directly over phone/ whatsapp/ facebook/ in person. We need as much support as possible!!!
15/02/16, 10:48 PM - LG Krishna Canada: 👍🏻
15/02/16, 10:48 PM - Sumeet Singh: Errr..... I know I may get blasted for this. But, I don't think any rights have been violated.
15/02/16, 10:49 PM - Sumeet Singh: Police arrested the wrong people, sure, but I don't think there has been any violation of freedom of speech
15/02/16, 10:50 PM - Adnan Waheed: Gaurav has no chill.
15/02/16, 10:50 PM - Sumeet Singh: 😄😄
15/02/16, 10:51 PM - Adnan Waheed: Can you explain in layman's terms what all that was about? Tldr.
15/02/16, 10:51 PM - Sumeet Singh: My pleasure
15/02/16, 10:51 PM - Gaurav McGill: 😊
15/02/16, 10:52 PM - LG Krishna Canada: You have a fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression but that includes certain restrictions such as statements that are against the sovereignty and integrity of India. This restriction was added by an amendment in 1963. The problem is that the government arbitrarily invokes this restriction.
15/02/16, 10:52 PM - Sumeet Singh: A bunch of students were protesting (peacefully, more or less). A few of them (4-5) started shouting anti-India slogans, something along the lines of "Death to india, Hail Pakistan"
15/02/16, 10:53 PM - Adnan Waheed: Classic.
15/02/16, 10:53 PM - Bryan Au: Within India?
15/02/16, 10:53 PM - Sumeet Singh: So the government, naturally overreacted. Picked up the wrong students, including the leader of the student union, who, btw, had nothing to do with any of this
15/02/16, 10:53 PM - Sumeet Singh: Yeah, in Delhi
15/02/16, 10:54 PM - Bryan Au: Lol shouting death to India in India
15/02/16, 10:54 PM - Bryan Au: Certain countries consider that treason lol
15/02/16, 10:54 PM - Sumeet Singh: So, while arresting the wrong students and deploying (and use of )excessive force in the university was wrong
15/02/16, 10:54 PM - Sumeet Singh: I don't think "freedom of expression" justifies the slogans
15/02/16, 10:55 PM - Ankit Balyan: I agree
15/02/16, 10:55 PM - Ankit Balyan: 👍
15/02/16, 10:55 PM - Sumeet Singh: @Bryan - yeah, they are being charged with sedition
15/02/16, 10:55 PM - LG Krishna Canada: This was sedition and they were arrested under the penal provisions for sedition I think.
15/02/16, 10:55 PM - Ankit Balyan: Most countries would consider that treason
15/02/16, 10:56 PM - Sumeet Singh: So, while our government and police is quite dickish most of the times. I think people take liberties under the guise of "being a minority" or "freedom of speech"
15/02/16, 10:58 PM - LG Krishna Canada: I don't think you get Freedom of speech in T-shirt sizes. You can't get small, medium or large freedom of speech. You either have it or you don't.
15/02/16, 10:59 PM - Adnan Waheed: Do you know what's a good place to get smoked meat from? I personally think Schwartz is overrated.
15/02/16, 10:59 PM - Sumeet Singh: @Adnan 😂😂😂
15/02/16, 10:59 PM - Ankit Balyan: 😂😂😂😂
15/02/16, 11:00 PM - Gaurav McGill: I think Krishna  just captured it perfectly
15/02/16, 11:00 PM - Yash Sinha: Reubens is better
15/02/16, 11:00 PM - Gaurav McGill: Sumeet, happy to discuss/ debate in person
15/02/16, 11:00 PM - Gaurav McGill: and as Adnan says, better to talk about steak here
15/02/16, 11:00 PM - Sumeet Singh: @Krishna - Really, man? In that case, do you mean to say that freedom of speech doesn't exist anywhere? Because try shouting Hail Osama, death to the US in america
15/02/16, 11:01 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Scalia, the very conservative supreme court judge that passed away Friday, is the one behind a decisive judgement that made it legal to burn the US flag, because it was protected by the freedom of speech.
15/02/16, 11:06 PM - Gaurav McGill: Well, I wouldn't hold the US up as an example on human rights, but since you mentioned it, let me remind you that a generation of Americans protested against the US during the Vietnam war even when it was in active war against a foreign nation. As far as I know, no one got arrested unless for destruction of property or turning violent.
15/02/16, 11:07 PM - Catherine Dupont: Scalia is a loss... for his family. 😜
15/02/16, 11:07 PM - Sumeet Singh: I don't know if any of them chanted "Jung rahegi, jung rahegi, US ki barbadi tak jung rahegi" "Hindustan ke tukde tukde honge"
15/02/16, 11:08 PM - Sumeet Singh: Translation for everyone else - "There will be war until the US gets ruined" "US will be broken into pieces"
15/02/16, 11:09 PM - Sumeet Singh: To top it all, they were members of ABVP - very well know for its hooliganism
15/02/16, 11:09 PM - Sumeet Singh: *known
15/02/16, 11:10 PM - Gaurav McGill: And ABVP is the one supported/ used by the Government in the crackdown against students
15/02/16, 11:11 PM - Gaurav McGill: in order to implicate students
15/02/16, 11:11 PM - Gaurav McGill: *Just clarifying lest it gives the impression that the students were hooligans
15/02/16, 11:13 PM - Sumeet Singh: We don't know that the students weren't hooligans
15/02/16, 11:13 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: <Media omitted>
15/02/16, 11:13 PM - Gaurav McGill: They were not- It was a peaceful protest
15/02/16, 11:14 PM - Gaurav McGill: Ha ha @Guillaume
15/02/16, 11:14 PM - Sumeet Singh: Don't get me wrong. I am all for freedom of expression. Everyone should have the right to criticize the government, call their own country names, or whatever. But literally saying that you want to go to war against your country? Sorry man, that's where I draw the line
15/02/16, 11:14 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I would love to hear all about it, especially if it can be an educated debate
15/02/16, 11:15 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Tomorrow?
15/02/16, 11:15 PM - Gaurav McGill: Sure! @Guillaume
15/02/16, 11:16 PM - Gaurav McGill: Okay- I have tech assignment to submit so auvoir for now
15/02/16, 11:26 PM - Adnan Waheed: Will there be pizza at this debate?
15/02/16, 11:58 PM - Gaurav McGill: Since some of you have asked- Here are 2 articles that will give briefly tell you what the issue and the debate is all about

16/02/16, 10:59 AM - Gaurav McGill: Oh okay- thanks!

18/02/16, 12:25 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Can't stop laughing...
18/02/16, 8:19 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Speaking of laughing, I was listening on the radio how Turkey is drifting away on the geopolitical map. They jail reporters, recent case of two journalists that showed video proof that Ankara is providing support to the Islamic state. The crazy thing here is that Turkey is member of NATO. It is becoming aggressive toward Russia, against the Kurds ( NATO allied), and planning joint ground operations with Saudi Arabia. It's a war in which everybody is at the same time allied and enemies.
18/02/16, 8:26 AM - Adnan Waheed: Why do you wake up so early, Guillermo?
18/02/16, 8:27 AM - Sara Mahabadi: Guillaume war between Kurds and Turks has a long history as far as I know...
18/02/16, 8:38 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: I know, the area is like a room where everybody is seating in weird shaped chairs, some don't have chairs other have, but very uncomfortable ones, they are all hungry but don't want to stand up and get the food because someone else might steal a piece of their chair.
18/02/16, 8:47 AM - Sara Mahabadi: Well.... Politics... Never easy to understand! Especially in that region...

23/02/16, 5:21 PM - Eric Galas: I feel like that's a message from the Architect of the Matrix saying you have reached the end
23/02/16, 5:22 PM - Sumeet Singh: Tonight at 8: Saleh becomes the first person to DDoS LinkedIn
23/02/16, 5:27 PM - Saleh: well i do double check the tinder matches against linkedin database maybe thts why lol

23/02/16, 11:06 PM - Sumeet Singh: Ah.. I broke the first two rules of the banter group, didn't I?
24/02/16, 9:31 AM - Scott Fulton: First rule of the banter group: Don't talk about the banter group?
24/02/16, 9:32 AM - Guillaume Charpenel: Haha

24/02/16, 2:20 PM - Sumeet Singh: Guys, the ex cfo and ceo of financial times is taking a class in 360 right now till 4, and everyone is invited.
24/02/16, 2:23 PM - Alienor: Taking or teaching?
24/02/16, 2:24 PM - Odilon: Lol. Teaching
24/02/16, 2:24 PM - Adnan Waheed: In Indian English students give lectures and exams while teachers take them. Weird, I know.
24/02/16, 2:24 PM - Alienor: Lol

24/02/16, 8:19 PM - Karen Sidhu: Suggestions?
24/02/16, 8:19 PM - Sumeet Singh: Gertz
24/02/16, 8:21 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yes Thompson house sounds great
24/02/16, 8:23 PM - Karen Sidhu: Thompson or Gertz??
24/02/16, 8:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Yes
24/02/16, 8:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I agree
24/02/16, 8:24 PM - Vivek Rai Canada: oui
24/02/16, 8:24 PM - Yash Sinha: Good idea
24/02/16, 8:24 PM - Sumeet Singh: Yeah
24/02/16, 8:28 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Is there fußball at thompson house?
24/02/16, 8:28 PM - Parker Donaldson: Gertz has coat chrck. Waste of cash.
24/02/16, 8:29 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Ok let's make a deal. If there is no coat check at Gert's we go there. Else thompson house
24/02/16, 8:29 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Coat check is a waste of monnet
24/02/16, 8:30 PM - Karen Sidhu: Let's go Gertz
24/02/16, 8:32 PM - LG Krishna Canada: Think there's mandatory coat check at Gerts
24/02/16, 8:35 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Ok Thompson's house then.. Coat check takes about 2 hours and costs 80$
24/02/16, 8:35 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: And it's only 12 meters more
24/02/16, 8:35 PM - Karen Sidhu: Sold!
24/02/16, 8:55 PM - Karen Sidhu: We're at Thompson house
24/02/16, 9:15 PM - LG Krishna Canada: How did you guys make it up there? Its slippery like crazy...
24/02/16, 9:15 PM - Karen Sidhu: We made it Krishna; you can do it too!
24/02/16, 9:16 PM - Yash Sinha: Krishna your new aerodynamic haircut should make it easier to walk uphill too
24/02/16, 9:22 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Pictures of the aerodynamic hair?
24/02/16, 9:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: <Media omitted>
24/02/16, 9:24 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's krishna's little brother visiting montre

24/02/16, 9:50 PM - Sumeet Singh: You're missing out

24/02/16, 10:28 PM - Edouard Lyan: <Media omitted>
24/02/16, 10:40 PM - Adnan Waheed: If it's gender neutral, why does it have a skirt on? We're not in Scotland.
24/02/16, 10:41 PM - Edouard Lyan: Haha
24/02/16, 10:41 PM - Yash Sinha: Read the fine print maybe?
25/02/16, 11:43 AM - Aiya: Hey everybody! As the tax season approaches, i am guessing that many of international students are trying to decide their tax residency. I have a very nice court case decision that can walk you through the domestic rules, and how a double tax treaty with your country can over-rule the domestic conclusion. Let me know if you'd like to read it to get some insight about determination of the tax residency for individuals.
25/02/16, 12:44 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: I would love to have to do my taxes... That would mean that I had some sort of income! 😬

I miss income!
25/02/16, 12:46 PM - Caroline: u need to do taxes even without income
25/02/16, 12:46 PM - Deepti Kaul: yeah
25/02/16, 12:46 PM - Deepti Kaul: lol
25/02/16, 12:47 PM - Deepti Kaul: Welcome to Canada!! 🇨🇦
25/02/16, 12:48 PM - Angela Hernandez: hahaha plus if Canada has an agreement with you country, as it does with Colombia, if you pay taxes in Colombia you need to relate it to the taxes you do here...in other words, hire an accoutant
25/02/16, 12:52 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: What are the taxes based on? 
20% of zero is still nothing...
25/02/16, 12:52 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: I'm very interested in learning more! Thank you Aiya!
25/02/16, 12:52 PM - Yash Sinha: Refunds
25/02/16, 12:53 PM - Caroline: u MIGHT get money bck from all the sales taxes etc
25/02/16, 12:53 PM - Yash Sinha: Surprise income beats no income
25/02/16, 12:53 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Oh! Now you got my attention!
25/02/16, 12:53 PM - Caroline: MIGHT
25/02/16, 12:55 PM - Ankit Balyan: Yeah.. now i want to know more...
25/02/16, 1:06 PM - Leon Montiel: If you guys buy the monthly metro pass save the receipt because you get tax credit on that
25/02/16, 1:06 PM - Ankit Balyan: 😳
25/02/16, 1:08 PM - Saleh: do we get tax credit on grocery shopping ? home rent ? maybe university fees ?? plz any of above
25/02/16, 1:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: I should stop throwing away my receipts.
25/02/16, 1:08 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: If this is not a joke, I am now, even more so, in love with this country!
25/02/16, 1:08 PM - Ankit Balyan: cant we show estatements confirming those payments?
25/02/16, 1:09 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: Back at home you are lucky if the bus/train even shows up....
😯
25/02/16, 1:09 PM - Aiya: Natasha, noted! Hey, we have some good advisors in this discussion.
25/02/16, 1:11 PM - Aiya: The very 1st step in the process is to figure out if your country signed a convention on double taxation with Canada
25/02/16, 1:11 PM - Saleh: UAE has no tax. next step plzz
25/02/16, 1:13 PM - Aiya: Next step is more complicated. I'll send you a document about local rules
25/02/16, 1:13 PM - Saleh: lool. 
step 1- your name. 
step2- tell me more
25/02/16, 1:13 PM - Aiya: Even if your country does not have tax, you still need to figure out where you are a resident
25/02/16, 1:24 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: What do you mean by "figure out where you are resident"?
I am a resident of Brazil, that has an agreement with Canada.
I just hold a student visa in Canada.
25/02/16, 1:43 PM - Leon Montiel: Ankit, I don't know man. I think that you will be fine as long as they don't audit you,
25/02/16, 1:58 PM - Angela Hernandez: lol what type of advise is that Leon
25/02/16, 1:59 PM - Leon Montiel: 😁
25/02/16, 2:19 PM - Ankit Balyan: its like saying.. you are fine unless you are caught 😂
25/02/16, 2:54 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: :)
25/02/16, 3:17 PM - Eric Galas: To Leon's point that "may" be sufficient but I bet if you look that type of information up on CRA. They would tell you what is an acceptable proof of purchase in case of audit.
25/02/16, 3:34 PM - Leon Montiel: I think that's only applicable for Quebec taxes though (yes, in Quebec we have to submit separate tax declarations to the province and to the federal government ). So you are more likely to find it in the website of Revenue Quebec
25/02/16, 3:52 PM - Adnan Waheed: The French always want to do things their own way.
25/02/16, 4:25 PM - Aiya: To Leon's point, that is correct. You need to submit one provincial + one federal return. The best source accountants use is a good software. I heard that some online solutions ask you different questions and compile both returns for you. Question to our Canadian classmates, is there any site/software you like to use?
25/02/16, 4:26 PM - Samira Khajehi: I always use UFILE. It is so user-friendly - you put in all the things you think might apply to you, then it asks you direct questions to confirm if it applies to you, and it creates your return so that you can upload it to the CRA
25/02/16, 4:26 PM - Samira Khajehi: It's free for students too I believe
25/02/16, 4:27 PM - Aiya: Cool! Thank you, Samira! I used to use professional software before. No access any more😕
25/02/16, 4:29 PM - Samira Khajehi: lol well I don't know how you'll find it since you're used to that, but as a non-professional I love it
25/02/16, 4:31 PM - Eric Galas: CRA also has free software so you can do it all online but never used it... I have heard the the ones like Ufile are easier to use so if that's also a free option as a student then that is a good option
25/02/16, 4:31 PM - Eric Galas: There is also turbotax Canada
25/02/16, 4:32 PM - Aiya: Note to internationals, you cannot e-file. If you are a non-resident, you'd need to mail your returns
25/02/16, 4:33 PM - Samira Khajehi: http://www.ufile.ca/tips-and-tools/file-for-free#students
25/02/16, 4:33 PM - Aiya: I will send some intro guide from the CRA about residency tonight
25/02/16, 4:33 PM - Aiya: 👍
25/02/16, 7:15 PM - Ali Akerman: http://youtu.be/ZSTXllndlVI
25/02/16, 7:17 PM - Adnan Waheed: Haha
25/02/16, 7:17 PM - Adnan Waheed: How'd you find this?
25/02/16, 7:39 PM - Neha Karnad: The one with Karl Moore is nice as well!
25/02/16, 7:40 PM - Gul Kurtar: So mean
25/02/16, 8:05 PM - Aiya: To follow up on today's discussion, I posted some links on our group in Fb. You will find a basic introduction in the document from the CRA, and very technical discussion made by the Tax Court of Canada. For locals, I posted a bulletin about moving expenses and scholarships. Enjoy them over your break! I hope you'll find them useful.
25/02/16, 8:07 PM - Aiya: By the end it will also become obvious why tax professional make money in this country 😁
25/02/16, 8:36 PM - Sumeet Singh: Today's moral of the story from the Strategy in Context class "If you listen to everybody, you lose your ass."
25/02/16, 8:36 PM - Yash Sinha: Needs more context
25/02/16, 8:37 PM - Ryan Shields: Needs more strategy
25/02/16, 8:37 PM - Sumeet Singh: - Prof. E. Lifson, 2016
26/02/16, 10:43 AM - Rita Komarova: Girls coming to the women's event, the event is starting soon!
26/02/16, 10:44 AM - Damien: ok thanks

26/02/16, 12:59 PM - Caroline: ours is pizza
26/02/16, 12:59 PM - Caroline: no comparision
26/02/16, 1:03 PM - Yash Sinha: Dayumn
26/02/16, 1:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: Where are you, Ponnudurai?
26/02/16, 1:29 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Wmma brunch, what a great event
26/02/16, 1:29 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: (And not only because of the food!)
26/02/16, 1:31 PM - Katya: But the food is amazing 😍😋 thank you Natasha and Aaron

26/02/16, 2:01 PM - Gul Kurtar: Thank you rita angela and jahnavi. It was great in every way👏👏👍

26/02/16, 2:47 PM - Angela Hernandez: Thank you all for
Coming to the event! I felt so happy to see so much support
26/02/16, 2:49 PM - Deepti Kaul: Event was amazing! Great job!
26/02/16, 2:49 PM - Rita Komarova: Thank you everyone for attending and actively participating! 👏🏻
26/02/16, 3:14 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: <Media omitted>
26/02/16, 3:22 PM - Angela Hernandez: This will change probably
26/02/16, 3:23 PM - Angela Hernandez: Alberta, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan are probably going to decrease
26/02/16, 3:24 PM - Rodrigo Gosende: What's in New Foundland?
26/02/16, 3:28 PM - Angela Hernandez: Oil
26/02/16, 3:28 PM - Angela Hernandez: Off shore operation
26/02/16, 3:30 PM - Jayden: Lol Berta has already decreased 😥
26/02/16, 3:56 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: Interesting data. What about in PPP? 59k$ might go further in new Brunswick than 72 k$ in bc
26/02/16, 4:18 PM - Kristov: I could provide some additional info about Alberta if you're interested: this is from 2012, oil was about $90 a barrel and on an upswing, so lots of hiring and expansion. These figures are also after-tax median income, and Alberta had a flat 10% income tax rate which has since been replaced with an incremental version. With regards to PPP, it's relatively low in Alberta despite a lack of PST, especially where most of the money was being made, in Ft. Mcmurray. There, a month's rent in a dumpy trailer could cost over 3k and consumer goods have extra markups. Also factor in a lack of infrastructure development, no artistic culture, and a male to female ratio of 2:1. The good times were not exactly good times.
26/02/16, 4:19 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Youz a genius. Strongly summarized.
26/02/16, 4:20 PM - Andrew Mutrie: Newfoundland, @rodrigo is an island of rock, fish, lobster, and some of the finest funniest talking folks in all the seven kingdoms.
26/02/16, 4:20 PM - Andrew Mutrie: (And some recent off shore oil exploration!)
26/02/16, 4:24 PM - Kristov: One last thing, a lot of work in Alberta was done in contract labor format. Meaning companies paid workers higher wages but didn't permanently hire them into their companies. Ergo, no benefits, no sick days, no pension etc.
26/02/16, 4:25 PM - Kristov: Those are important factors to consider in total compensation calculations.
26/02/16, 4:39 PM - Adnan Waheed: Hi, Kristov. Can you set me up with a well-to-do gal from Alberta? Thanks.
26/02/16, 4:47 PM - Andrew Mutrie: You're first step is some cowboy boots Adnan. Find a fine cobbler and go from there
26/02/16, 5:38 PM - Kristov: Adnan, I said a male to female ratio of 2:1. Women there are in very short supply, so I'm afraid I can't help ya.
26/02/16, 5:46 PM - Adnan Waheed: Sorry, I got too excited and missed some critical info.
26/02/16, 6:29 PM - Gaurav McGill: Setting up with a guy would probably be easier
26/02/16, 6:29 PM - Natasha Sakina Alani: Just getting caught up. Nice work Rita, Angela and Jhanavi. :) thank you for the throwing some business our way, Rita. It meant a whole lot to us! Happy reading week guys! 💸☃🍻
26/02/16, 7:28 PM - Nathalie: The brunch was awesome! Food was deeeelicious! Thank you all! 
P.s. we had a 1:1 ratio at the brunch haha

28/02/16, 3:28 PM - Adnan Waheed: Oh, that's a lotta work.

28/02/16, 4:09 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: It's just a birthday
28/02/16, 4:13 PM - Andrew Mutrie: You're right Guillaume. You should wear some coveralls, fluorescent suspenders, a hard hat and fire up a chain saw
28/02/16, 4:14 PM - Andrew Mutrie: From Montreal to the world. "Gui grand-bois" making his debut
28/02/16, 4:24 PM - Gaurav McGill: This chat deserves to be saved for posterity

29/02/16, 12:06 PM - Adnan Waheed: Ah, shit.
29/02/16, 12:07 PM - Guillaume Charpenel: I understand. Why are you in a country where the rain transforms into ice and makes people fall when you could be in Columbia where the sun makes you skin healthy and eat the freshest fruits on the plant? I would feel lost
29/02/16, 12:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: I will agree with the weather, Guillermo. They said winter's gonna be fun. Where's the fun?
29/02/16, 12:08 PM - Yash Sinha: I think you need to be fun to be able to have fun
29/02/16, 12:08 PM - Adnan Waheed: I've already fallen twice on the pavement.
29/02/16, 12:09 PM - Adnan Waheed: Schwartz will be fun. Are we going tomorrow? It's gonna be sunny tomorrow.
